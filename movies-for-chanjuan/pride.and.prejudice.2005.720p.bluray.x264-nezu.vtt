01:03.250 --> 01:14.690
傲慢与偏见

02:11.840 --> 02:13.890
丽迪雅! 吉蒂! 
Lydia! Kitty!

02:50.380 --> 02:53.180
我的好老爷班纳特  你听说了吗? 
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.260
尼日斐花园终于租出去了
Netherfield Park is let at last.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.060
你难道不想知道是谁租去了吗? 
Do you not want to know who has taken it?

02:58.270 --> 03:01.870
既然你这么想告诉我  我的好太太
As you wish to tell me, my dear,

03:01.870 --> 03:04.270
我只能洗耳恭听了
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.160
吉蒂  我不是跟你说过吗  不要偷听
Kitty, what have I told you about listening at the door?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.160
是位从北部来的彬格莱先生
There's a Mr Bingley arrived from the North.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.580
-一年有五千磅的收入! -真的? 
- Five thousand a year!  - Really?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.370
-他是单身汉! -谁是单身汉? 
- He's single!  - Who's single?

03:21.580 --> 03:24.250
显然是彬格莱先生  吉蒂! 
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

03:24.420 --> 03:26.290
这关女儿们什么事? 
How can that possibly affect them?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.630
班纳特老爷  你怎么这么讨厌? 
Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome?

03:28.800 --> 03:31.170
告诉你吧  他一定会娶我们女儿中的一个当太太
You know he must marry one of them.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.380
他住到这儿来就是为了这个? 
That is his design in settling here?

03:33.590 --> 03:35.800
你得马上去拜访拜访他
You must go and visit him at once.

03:36.010 --> 03:38.930
天哪  人啊
Good heavens. People.

03:41.390 --> 03:45.480
要是你不去  叫我们怎么去? 你是知道的  班纳特
For we may not visit if you do not, as you well know, Mr Bennet.

03:45.650 --> 03:48.010
你在听我说话吗? 你从来都不听
Are you listening? You never listen.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.860
你一定要去  爸爸! 马上! 
You must, Papa! At once!

03:50.030 --> 03:52.570
没必要  我已经去过了
There's no need. I already have.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.200
-你去过了? -什么时候? 
- You have?  - When?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.950
噢  班纳特老爷  你怎么能够这样戏弄我? 
Oh, Mr Bennet, how can you tease me so?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.540
你就不能体谅体谅我那脆弱的神经吗? 
Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?

04:01.750 --> 04:05.330
你错怪我了  我的好太太  我非常尊重你的神经
You mistake me, my dear. I have the highest respect for them.

04:05.540 --> 04:08.790
它们是我20多年的老朋友了
They've been my constant companions these twenty years.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
爸爸! 
Papa!

04:10.170 --> 04:11.420
-他亲切吗? -谁? 
- Is he amiable?  - Who?

04:11.590 --> 04:13.970
-他帅吗? -那是当然
- Is he handsome?  - He's sure to be.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.340
一年有五千镑的人  就算有什么毛病也没关系啦
With 5,000 a year, it would not matter if he had warts.

04:17.510 --> 04:18.890
谁有毛病? 
Who's got warts?

04:19.050 --> 04:22.310
我倒想看看他会娶什么样的女孩
I will consent to his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.730
-那么他明天也会去舞会吗? -我想是的
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?  - I believe so.

04:27.980 --> 04:31.820
-班纳特老爷! -我要穿你的棉布衣了! 
- Mr Bennet!  - I have to have your muslin!

04:31.980 --> 04:33.800
我会把我的绿拖鞋借给你! 
I'll lend you my green slippers!

04:33.800 --> 04:34.820
那本来就是我的
They were mine.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.920
我会帮你做一星期的针线活  
I'll do your mending for a week.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.740
我会帮你重新装饰你的新帽子
I'll retrim your new bonnet.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.660
那我就帮你做两星期
Two weeks I'll do it for.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.240
不一样! 不一样
It's not the same! It's not the same.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.300
我快喘不过气了
I can't breathe.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.840
我连脚趾头都差点给踩掉了
I think one of my toes just came off.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.980
全场男士要是有人没在今晚爱上你
If every man does not end the evening in love with you,

05:51.150 --> 05:52.940
那我对美丽就没什么好评价的了
then I'm no judge of beauty.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.950
或者对男士们没什么好评价的了  
Or men.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.150
不  要评价他们太容易了
No, they are far too easy to judge.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.860
他们并不都那么糟糕
They're not all bad.

05:58.030 --> 06:00.910
以我有限的经历  他们说的都是一本正经的废话
Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.370
总有一天  有人入了你的法眼
One day, someone will catch your eye,

06:03.580 --> 06:05.950
到时候你就不会这么口无遮拦了
and then you'll have to watch your tongue.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.430
你能来真是太好了
How good of you to come.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.270
哪一位鲜艳的孔雀是我们的彬格莱先生? 
Which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?

06:31.440 --> 06:34.190
右边的是他  左边的是他的妹妹
He's on the right. On the left is his sister.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.790
长着奇怪眉毛的那个? 
The person with the quizzical brow?

06:36.790 --> 06:39.400
那个是他的好朋友达西先生
That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.090
他看上去挺痛苦的  可怜的人  
He looks miserable, poor soul.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.990
他可能痛苦  但并不可怜
He may be, but poor he is not.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
说来听听
Tell me.

06:45.370 --> 06:48.120
一年有一万英镑的收入他拥有半个的德贝郡
10000 a year, and he owns half of Derbyshire.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.330
这痛苦的半个德贝郡
The miserable half.

07:17.730 --> 07:22.610
班纳特老爷  你一定要马上把他介绍给你的女儿们
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him to the girls immediately.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.320
朝彬格莱先生微笑  微笑
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
曼丽
Mary.

07:43.090 --> 07:46.010
彬格莱先生  我的长女  你已经认识
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.370
班纳特太太  吉英·班纳特小姐  
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,

07:49.370 --> 07:51.600
伊丽莎白还有曼丽·班纳特小姐
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.210
很荣幸见到你们  
It is a pleasure.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.520
我还有两个女儿  不过她们在跳舞
I have two others, but they're already dancing.

07:55.690 --> 07:58.060
我很高兴能与你们相识
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.920
请允许我向你们介绍达西先生
And may I introduce Mr Darcy

08:00.920 --> 08:03.570
他来自德贝郡的彭伯里庄园
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.430
你喜欢赫特福德郡吗? 
How do you like it here in Hertfordshire?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.590
很喜欢
Very much.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.100
尼日斐的图书馆  我听说是最好的图书馆之一
The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.400
这真让我深感惭愧  我不是一个好的读者
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good reader.

08:34.410 --> 08:35.730
我更喜欢户外运动
 I prefer being out of doors.

08:35.940 --> 08:38.480
噢  我是说  我能读书  当然
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

08:38.690 --> 08:42.110
我可不建议你在户外读书哦
And I'm not suggesting you can't read out of doors.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.860
我非常希望我能多读点书
I wish I read more,

08:43.860 --> 08:46.030
但是总有这样那样的事情要做
but there seem to be so many other things to do.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.490
对  我就是这个意思
That's exactly what I meant.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.540
妈妈  妈妈! 你肯定不会相信我们要说的事
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe what we're about to tell you.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.330
-说啊! -她一定会掩饰
- Tell me!  - She's going to take the veil.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.880
-军团要来了! -军官们? 
- The regiment are coming!  - Officers?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.300
他们整个冬天将驻扎在这里  就在这里哦! 
They're going to be stationed the whole winter, right here.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.010
-军官们? -长期驻扎哦
- Officers?  - As far as the eye can see.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.390
噢  瞧  吉英在和彬格莱先生在跳舞
Oh, look. Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.060
班纳特老爷
Mr Bennet.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.030
你想跳舞吗  达西先生? 
Do you dance, Mr Darcy?

09:35.030 --> 09:37.330
不想  不过如果你想跳的话我可以奉陪
Not if I can help it.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.310
我不知道你会来这看我  出什么事了? 
I didn't know you were coming to see me. What's the matter?

09:59.520 --> 10:04.010
我们从罗夫纳酒店千里迢迢赶来的就为这? 
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square, are we not,

10:04.010 --> 10:05.190
达西先生? 
Mr Darcy?

10:05.360 --> 10:07.570
我生平没见过今天晚上这么多可爱的姑娘们
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

10:07.780 --> 10:10.240
舞场上唯一的美女在跟你跳舞
You were dancing with the only handsome girl.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.410
她是我这辈子见过的最美丽的尤物
She is the most beautiful creature I have ever beheld.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.940
不过她妹妹伊丽莎白也很讨人喜欢啊  
But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.

10:16.940 --> 10:17.950
她长得还行
Perfectly tolerable.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.840
不过也没漂亮到让我动心的地步
Not handsome enough to tempt me.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.420
你还是回到你的舞伴身边去欣赏她的笑脸吧
Return to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.040
犯不着把时间浪费在我的身上
You're wasting your time with me.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.890
往好的一面想  伊丽莎白
Count your blessings, Lizzie.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.550
他要是喜欢你  你就得和他聊天啦
If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.010
说得是
Precisely.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.930
就算他拥有整个德贝郡  我也不愿意和他跳舞
I wouldn't dance with him for all of Derbyshire,

10:38.100 --> 10:40.480
何况他只拥有半个而已
Iet alone the miserable half.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.580
等等! 
Wait!

12:01.520 --> 12:04.550
我很喜欢这里  卢卡斯小姐  
I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.020
你跳得真好  彬格莱先生
How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.480
我从没跳得这么尽兴
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

12:09.690 --> 12:12.530
我女儿吉英的舞跳得很不错  对吧? 
My daughter Jane is a splendid dancer, is she not?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.650
她确实跳得很好
She is indeed.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.870
你的朋友卢卡斯小姐  是个非常风趣的年轻女士
Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.740
噢  是啊  我可喜欢她了
Oh, yes, I adore her.

12:20.910 --> 12:25.080
-可惜的是她不够漂亮  -妈妈! 
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.  - Mama!

12:25.250 --> 12:28.750
噢  但是伊丽莎白绝不会承认她相貌平平
Oh, but Lizzie would never admit that she's plain.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.170
当然啦  我的吉英才是这个郡最漂亮的可人儿
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered the beauty of the county.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.340
妈妈  求求你! 
Mama, please!

12:34.550 --> 12:37.640
她15岁那年  就有位绅士深深地爱上了她
When she was 15, a gentleman was so much in love with her,

12:37.800 --> 12:40.010
我敢肯定他会向她求婚
I was sure he would make her an offer.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.770
无论如何  他是写过不少可爱的诗给她
However, he did write her some very pretty verses.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.180
不过也就到此为止了
And that put paid to it.

12:45.350 --> 12:48.770
我真惊讶  是谁发现了诗还有熄灭爱情的力量
I wonder who discovered the power of poetry in driving away love.

12:48.980 --> 12:50.850
我还以为诗能滋养爱情呢
I thought poetry was the food of love.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.320
对坚定的爱情确实如此
Of a fine, stout love.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.970
但是如果只是暧昧的喜好
But if it is only a vague inclination,

12:53.970 --> 12:55.990
一首蹩脚的十四行诗就能轻易毁了它
one poor sonnet will kill it.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.200
那么  你推荐用什么来激发爱情呢? 
So, what do you recommend to encourage affection?

13:00.160 --> 13:06.160
跳舞  即使舞伴长得也就是还行而已
Dancing. Even if one's partner is barely tolerable.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.110
彬格莱先生真是位典型的好青年
Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.090
有见识  有趣味..  
Sensible, good-humoured...

13:34.100 --> 13:35.780
英俊  非常富有...
Handsome, conveniently rich...

13:35.940 --> 13:38.780
婚姻不应该以金钱为出发点
Marriage should not be driven by thoughts of money.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.160
我只会为真挚的爱而结婚
Only deep love will persuade me to marry.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.920
所以我势必成为一位老姑娘  
Which is why I'll end up an old maid.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.000
你真的认为他喜欢我吗? 
Do you really believe he liked me?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.540
他几乎整晚都在和你跳舞
He danced with you most of the night,

13:47.540 --> 13:49.670
没跳的时候  眼睛也一刻不离开你
and stared at you the rest.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.840
我不反对你喜欢他  反正你以前也喜欢过不少蠢货
I give you leave to like him. You've liked many stupider.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.300
你也太容易对人产生好感了
You're a great deal too apt to like people in general.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.420
在你眼里  天下都是好人
All the world is good in your eyes.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.680
他的朋友可不算好人
Not his friend.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.890
我到现在都不敢相信他居然那么说你
I still can't believe what he said about you.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.470
达西先生? 
Mr Darcy?

14:04.640 --> 14:06.750
要不是他伤了我的虚荣心
I'd more easily forgive his vanity

14:06.750 --> 14:09.440
我对他的虚荣倒还蛮理解的
had he not wounded mine.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.400
不过不用担心  恐怕我们再也不会交谈了
But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again.

14:43.930 --> 14:46.060
他和卢卡斯小姐跳舞了
He danced with Miss Lucas.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.100
我们都在那看到了  我的好太太
We were all there, dear.

14:48.270 --> 14:50.390
真可惜她不够漂亮
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.310
看来她注定要成为老处女了
There's a spinster in the making and no mistake.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.150
第四支舞是和金小姐跳的
The fourth with a Miss King of little standing,

14:56.320 --> 14:58.440
第五支又是跟吉英跳的
and the fifth again with Jane.

14:58.650 --> 15:01.900
要是他稍许体谅我一点  他真该把脚给扭了才好
If he had any compassion, he would've sprained his ankle.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.240
你说得倒轻巧
The way you carry on,

15:03.410 --> 15:06.490
也不想想  我们女儿只能指望继承一千镑的遗产
you'd think our girls look forward to a grand inheritance.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.950
你去世之时  这可是说来就来的事儿
When you die, which may be very soon,

15:09.120 --> 15:11.240
到时候他们不会给我们留一片瓦
they will be left without a roof over their head

15:11.240 --> 15:13.670
他们会拿走他们名下的每个子儿
nor a penny to their name.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.690
拜托  现在才早上十点  
Please, it's ten in the morning.

15:15.690 --> 15:17.420
给班纳特小姐的信  夫人
A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

15:17.590 --> 15:21.090
从尼日斐庄园寄出的
From Netherfield Hall.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.970
赞美上帝  我们有救了! 
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

15:25.180 --> 15:30.140
快  吉英  快  噢  多么愉快的一天啊! 
Make haste, Jane, make haste. Oh, happy day!

15:31.640 --> 15:34.190
卡罗琳·彬格莱写来的
It is from Caroline Bingley.

15:34.400 --> 15:39.110
她邀请我和她共进晚餐
She has invited me to dine with her.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.360
-她哥哥要出去吃饭  -出去吃饭? 
- Her brother will be dining out.  - Dining out?

15:42.530 --> 15:44.490
-我能用马车吗? -我想想
- Can I take the carriage?  - Let me see.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.770
那太远了走不过去的  
It is too far to walk.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.370
他没道理这么做呀
This is unaccountable of him.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.450
妈妈  为吉英准备马车? 
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

15:52.580 --> 15:56.170
当然不  她要骑马去
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.210
骑马! 
Horseback!

16:14.600 --> 16:16.400
伊丽莎白
Lizzie.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.940
这下她得在那留宿了  不出我所料
Now she'll have to stay the night, exactly as I predicted.

16:20.110 --> 16:23.280
天哪  老婆子  你做媒的技巧
Good grief, woman, your skills in the art of matchmaking

16:23.440 --> 16:25.320
简直出神入化
are positively occult.

16:25.490 --> 16:30.120
不过  妈妈  你连呼风唤雨也会啊
Though I don't think, Mama, you can take credit for making it rain.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.500
"除非我好了些  不然朋友们不会让我回家
"My friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better.

16:38.670 --> 16:42.750
除了喉咙发炎  发烧  头痛  我都挺好的"
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

16:42.920 --> 16:44.340
吉英要是因此送了命
If Jane does die it

16:44.340 --> 16:48.140
知道她这是听你的话去追彬格莱  也算是个安慰
will be a comfort to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.640
哪有小感冒就送命的道理
People do not die of colds.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.220
但她会因为有这么一个母亲而羞愧死
But she may perish with the shame of having such a mother.

16:55.350 --> 16:58.100
我必须立刻去尼日斐
I must go to Netherfield at once.

17:11.200 --> 17:16.250
巴瑟斯特夫人正在按照法国风格重新装修舞厅
Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.630
有点不爱国  你不觉得吗? 
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

17:22.090 --> 17:25.090
伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐到
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

17:38.810 --> 17:41.020
天哪  你是走着来的吗? 
Good Lord, did you walk here?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.230
是的
I did.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.600
真抱歉打扰了  我姐姐怎么样了? 
I'm so sorry. How is my sister?

17:53.600 --> 17:54.620
她在楼上
She's upstairs.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.790
谢谢
Thank you.

18:08.300 --> 18:13.180
天哪  你看到她的裙摆没? 足足有6英寸的泥浆
My goodness, did you see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.510
她看上去像从中世纪来的
She looked positively mediaeval.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.230
我觉得很不好意思  他们对我都非常好
I feel such a terrible imposition. They're being so kind to me.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.190
不知道他俩谁更高兴看到你在这
I don't know who is more pleased at your being here,

18:23.190 --> 18:25.980
是妈妈还是彬格莱先生呢? 
Mama or Mr Bingley.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.620
谢谢你们对我姐姐的精心照顾
Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently.

18:33.820 --> 18:36.120
她在这比在家要舒服多了
She's in far better comfort than at home.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.990
乐意之至
It's a pleasure.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.040
我不是说我乐意她生病  当然不是
I mean, it's not a pleasure that she's ill. Of course not.

18:42.250 --> 18:46.090
我乐意的是她在这生病了
It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.550
人怕出名猪怕壮啊
Not going to be famous, our pig.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.050
后背是黑色  但是和诺里奇的猪没任何关系
Black on the back, but not related to the learned pig of Norwich.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.350
-现在那猪...  -班纳特老爷
- Now that pig is...  - Mr Bennet.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.850
计划进行得一帆风顺  他已经几乎爱上她了
It's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.

19:02.060 --> 19:04.270
-谁  布洛申? -彬格先莱生
- Who is, blossom?  - Mr Bingley.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.770
他不在乎她一文不名
He doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.190
他的钱足够他们俩用的
He has more than enough for the two of them.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.360
-我们怎么结识他们? -好办! 
- How will we meet them?  - Easy!

19:11.530 --> 19:12.610
等等我! 
Wait for me!

19:12.780 --> 19:15.700
你把东西掉在地上  他们帮你拾起来
You drop something. They pick it up.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.200
这样自然就认识了
And then you're introduced.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.920
军官! 
Officers!

19:59.200 --> 20:02.540
你写信写得出奇的快啊  达西先生
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.790
你这话可说得不对  其实我写得相当慢
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.590
你得写多少封信啊  达西先生? 
How many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.630
生意上的信  我想你一定很厌烦吧
Letters of business. How odious I should think them.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.670
幸亏得写这些信的人是我  而不是你
It is fortunate, then, they fall to me and not you.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.390
告诉令妹  我很想和她见见面
Tell your sister I long to see her.

20:17.590 --> 20:20.930
-我已经遵命告诉过她了  -我太喜爱她了
- I've already told her once.  - I do dote on her.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.440
她寄来给我装饰桌子的那张美丽的小图案
I was quite in raptures

20:23.440 --> 20:24.350
我喜欢极了
at her beautiful design for a table.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.410
可否请你通融一下
Perhaps you will give me leave

20:25.420 --> 20:27.770
容我下次再代为转达? 
to defer your raptures.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.070
这一次我可写不下这么多啦
I have not room enough to do them justice.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.110
你们这些年轻小姐真是多才多艺
You young ladies are so accomplished.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.740
你什么意思? 
What do you mean?

20:34.740 --> 20:36.780
你们会为桌子作画  会弹钢琴
You paint tables, play the piano

20:36.950 --> 20:38.370
还能给垫子绣花
and embroider cushions.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.700
我还从没听说过哪位小姐不被称为多才多艺的
I never heard of a lady, but people say she's accomplished.

20:41.910 --> 20:44.120
这个词被过于滥用了
The word is applied too liberally.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.620
我认识的真正称得上多才多艺的女士不超过6个
I do not know more half a dozen women that are truly accomplished.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.420
我也是
Nor I.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.750
天哪  你对这个概念一定深有体会
Goodness, you must comprehend a great deal in the idea.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.550
-是的  -绝对
- I do.  - Absolutely.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.430
她必须通晓音乐  歌唱  绘画  跳舞
She must have a knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing

20:58.590 --> 21:01.930
以及现代语言  才称得上多才多艺
and the modern languages to deserve the word.

21:02.140 --> 21:05.980
还有言谈举止
And something in her air and manner of walking.

21:06.180 --> 21:09.060
她必须通过广泛的阅读来扩展自身视野
And she must improve her mind by extensive reading.

21:09.230 --> 21:12.980
难怪你只认识6位多才多艺的女士了
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.

21:13.150 --> 21:14.820
我甚至怀疑你一位都不认识  
I wonder at you knowing any.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.490
你对同性的要求这么严格的吗? 
Are you so severe on your own sex?

21:16.700 --> 21:18.480
我从没见过这样的女士
I never saw such a woman.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.160
这样的女士一定令人望而生畏
She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

21:23.580 --> 21:27.080
伊丽莎白小姐  我们在房间里随便走走吧
Miss Elizabeth, let us take a turn about the room.

21:44.310 --> 21:45.760
这很提神  不是吗
It's refreshing, is it not,

21:45.760 --> 21:49.020
坐了那么久  走动一下可以提提精神
after sitting so long in one attitude?

21:49.230 --> 21:52.480
我想这也是种小技艺吧
It is a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose.

21:52.650 --> 21:54.860
你不和我们一起走走吗  达西先生? 
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

21:55.070 --> 21:56.360
你们的动机不外乎两种
You can only have two motives,

21:56.360 --> 21:58.570
但我若是一起走的话就有碍于你们
and I would interfere with either.

21:58.780 --> 22:00.820
他这是什么意思? 
What can he mean?

22:00.990 --> 22:04.240
要让他失望的话  最好就是什么也别问他
The surest way to disappoint him would be to ask him nothing.

22:04.450 --> 22:07.200
一定要告诉我们  达西先生
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.580
要么就是  你们俩是心腹之交
Either you are in each other's confidence

22:11.750 --> 22:13.880
有些私事要聊聊
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

22:14.090 --> 22:16.300
要么就是你们自以为散起步来
or you are conscious that your figures

22:16.500 --> 22:19.670
体态特别优美  所以要散散步
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.250
倘若是出于第一个动机
If the first,

22:22.250 --> 22:23.930
我夹在你们中间就会妨碍你们
I should get in your way.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.180
倘若是出于第二个动机
If the second,

22:25.180 --> 22:27.020
那么我坐在这可以更好地欣赏你们
I can admire you much better from here.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.560
亏他说得出  我们该怎么罚他呀? 
How shall we punish him for such a speech?

22:29.730 --> 22:31.130
我们可以取笑他一番
We could laugh at him.

22:31.130 --> 22:33.770
不行  达西先生是不能让人笑话的
No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

22:33.940 --> 22:36.450
你是否太骄傲了些  达西先生? 
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

22:36.450 --> 22:38.650
你认为骄傲是缺点还是优点? 
And would you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

22:38.820 --> 22:41.820
-说不好  -我们在试着找出你的缺点
- I couldn't say.  - We're trying to find a fault in you.

22:42.030 --> 22:44.090
别人的愚蠢和过错我本应该赶快忘掉
I find it hard to forgive

22:44.090 --> 22:45.120
却偏偏忘不掉
the follies and vices of others,

22:45.280 --> 22:47.080
人家得罪了我  我也忘不掉
or their offences against me.

22:47.290 --> 22:50.790
我对人一旦失去了好感  就永远没有好感了
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.920
噢  天哪  我不能取笑你了
Oh, dear. I cannot tease you about that.

22:56.090 --> 22:58.210
真可惜  我很爱取笑人
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.630
我想是家族传统吧
A family trait, I think.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.460
班纳特太太  班纳特三小姐  班纳特四小姐
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss Bennet

23:32.460 --> 23:34.620
还有班纳特五小姐到  先生
and a Miss Bennet, sir.

23:34.790 --> 23:37.790
乡下所有叫班纳特的都来我们家了? 
Are we to receive every Bennet in the country?

23:40.510 --> 23:43.840
你的屋子多可爱啊  先生
What an excellent room you have, sir.

23:44.010 --> 23:47.680
家具都这么贵重
Such expensive furnishings.

23:47.850 --> 23:50.850
我非常希望你能留在这  彬格莱先生
I do hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

23:51.060 --> 23:55.850
当然  我觉得乡村非常的有趣  不是吗  达西? 
Absolutely, I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

23:56.020 --> 23:57.730
我觉得是够有趣的
I find it perfectly adequate.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.820
虽说乡下碰不到像城里那么多形形色色的人
Even if society is a little less varied than in town.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.860
碰不到? 没这回事
Less varied? Not at all.

24:03.070 --> 24:05.320
就我所知  平常跟我们来往吃饭的
We dine with four and 20 families

24:05.320 --> 24:07.120
就有足足二十四家  各色各样
of all shapes and sizes.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.740
例如威廉·卢卡斯爵士就非常和蔼可亲
Sir William Lucas, for instance, is a very agreeable man.

24:11.950 --> 24:15.710
比起某些爵位还不如他的人  他一点也不妄自尊大
And a good deal less self-important than some people half his rank.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.590
彬格莱先生  你真的要在这举办舞会吗? 
Mr Bingley, is it true you will hold a ball here?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.300
舞会? 
A ball?

24:21.460 --> 24:26.180
那将是认识新朋友最好的方式  你可以邀请军人们
It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.340
-噢  办个舞会吧! -吉蒂! 
- Oh, do hold a ball!  - Kitty!

24:28.680 --> 24:31.390
等你姐姐复元了  由你随便定个日期就行
When your sister recovers, you shall name the day.

24:31.560 --> 24:36.100
我想通过舞会结识新交有点不够理智
I think a ball is an irrational way to gain new acquaintance.

24:36.310 --> 24:40.440
如果时兴聊天而不是跳舞那该多好
It would be better if conversation, not dancing, were the order of the day.

24:40.610 --> 24:44.740
聊天确实理性得多  不过光聊天的话那还叫舞会么
Indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.530
谢谢  曼丽
Thank you, Mary.

24:47.610 --> 24:51.910
这地方多么壮观多么大气啊  不是吗  亲爱的? 
What a fine imposing place to be sure, is it not, my dears?

24:52.080 --> 24:55.410
全郡再也找不到这么好的房子了
There's no house to equal it in the county.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.330
-达西先生  -班纳特小姐
- Mr Darcy.  - Miss Bennet.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.330
-她在那  -我对你感激不尽
- There she is.  - I don't know how to thank you.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.340
如果觉得不舒服  尽管来找我好了
You're welcome any time you feel the least bit poorly.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.670
谢谢你有生气的陪伴  让我受益匪浅
Thank you for your stimulating company. Most instructive.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.430
不客气  荣幸之至
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.060
-达西先生  -伊丽莎白小姐
- Mr Darcy.  - Miss Elizabeth.

25:27.490 --> 25:32.450
这时有个很长的鞭子  像母牛一样
And then there was one with great long lashes, like a cow.

25:32.620 --> 25:35.370
叫希尔太太给我们做牛腩  伊丽莎白
Ask Mrs Hill to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

25:35.540 --> 25:38.960
注意  只要一块  我们没钱
Just the one, mind. We're not made of money.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.340
我的好太太  希望你今天的午饭准备得丰盛一些
I hope, my dear, you've ordered a good dinner today.

25:45.550 --> 25:49.380
恐怕今天有客人来
I've reason to expect an addition to our family party.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.350
他就是柯林斯先生  那位可怕的堂哥
His name's Mr Collins, the dreaded cousin.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.970
-那个继承人吗? -是啊  继承所有家产
- Who is to inherit?  - Everything.

25:55.180 --> 25:58.020
连我的钢琴凳都是柯林斯先生的
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.190
什么时候? 
When?

25:59.390 --> 26:02.400
只要他愿意  他随时能把我们撵出这所屋子
He may turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases.

26:02.610 --> 26:04.740
我们家的产业不能留给我们这些可怜的女人
The estate passes directly to him

26:04.740 --> 26:05.860
却要让别人来继承
and not to us poor females.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.490
柯林斯先生  愿为你效劳
Mr Collins, at your service.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.800
多漂亮的房间啊  多漂亮的土豆啊
What a superbly featured room and what excellent potatoes.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.970
我好多年都没有吃到这样的蔬菜了
It's many years since I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

26:32.130 --> 26:36.430
是哪位堂妹的厨艺如此高超  令我称赞不已? 
To which fair cousin should I compliment the excellence of the cooking?

26:36.640 --> 26:39.100
我们还算过得去  还请得起厨子
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

26:39.270 --> 26:41.230
好极了
Excellent.

26:41.390 --> 26:44.810
我非常高兴看到这份产业能供得起如此优越的生活
I'm very pleased the estate can afford such a living.

26:48.360 --> 26:48.970
我三生有幸
I'm honoured to have

26:48.970 --> 26:51.780
能有位像凯瑟琳·德·包尔夫人那样的女资助人
as my patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

26:51.950 --> 26:54.570
我想你们已经听说她了吧? 
You've heard of her, I presume?

26:54.740 --> 26:58.740
我的小教区毗邻她的庄园
My small rectory abuts her estate,

26:58.910 --> 27:01.580
罗新斯花园  她还常乘她的四轮小马车
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

27:01.750 --> 27:07.590
拜访我的寒舍
to drive by my humble dwelling in her little phaeton and ponies.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.380
她有亲人吗? 
Does she have any family?

27:09.590 --> 27:11.740
她有个女儿  将要继承罗新斯
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings

27:11.740 --> 27:14.050
还能继承非常可观的一笔遗产呢
and very extensive property.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.390
我常对凯瑟琳夫人说
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

27:16.550 --> 27:19.640
她的女儿天生就是公爵夫人的命
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

27:19.850 --> 27:25.600
因为她的气质优雅尊贵
for she has all the superior graces of elevated rank.

27:25.810 --> 27:29.570
这样巧妙的恭维  太太小姐们没有不乐意听的
These kind of compliments are always acceptable to the ladies,

27:29.780 --> 27:34.070
我总觉得我应该在这方面特别留意
and which I conceive myself particularly bound to pay.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.780
真为你高兴  柯林斯先生
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

27:36.950 --> 27:40.540
你能有这种才能  能够非常巧妙的捧人家的场
to possess the talent for flattering with such delicacy.

27:42.620 --> 27:46.130
你这种讨人喜欢的奉承话  是灵机一动呢
Do these attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment

27:46.290 --> 27:48.750
还是老早想好了的? 
or are they the result of previous study?

27:48.960 --> 27:51.510
大半是应景之作
They arise from what is passing at the time.

27:51.710 --> 27:54.540
不过有时候我也预先想好一些很好的小恭维话
And though I do sometimes amuse myself

27:54.540 --> 27:56.090
平常有机会就拿来应用
with arranging such little compliments,

27:56.300 --> 27:59.890
而且临时说的时候总是要装得自然而然
I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.

28:00.100 --> 28:04.190
相信我  没人想得到你的礼貌竟然是排练过的
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be rehearsed.

28:10.900 --> 28:14.400
我想晚饭后可以给大家读一到两个小时的书
After dinner, I thought I might read to you for an hour or two.

28:14.570 --> 28:17.570
我随身带着《讲道集》
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

28:17.740 --> 28:22.200
这是本关于行为道德的善辩集
which speak very eloquently on all matters moral.

28:22.410 --> 28:26.790
你读过《讲道集》吗  班纳特小姐? 
Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?

28:31.750 --> 28:36.720
班纳特太太  承蒙凯瑟琳·德·包尔夫人的厚爱
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

28:36.880 --> 28:39.350
提拔我担任教区牧师的职位
a parsonage of no mean size.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.640
我已经知道了
I have become aware of the fact.

28:41.850 --> 28:45.770
我真心希望能尽快给我的牧师住宅找到一位女主人
It is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it.

28:45.940 --> 28:49.360
我得告诉你  班纳特大小姐
And I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet

28:49.520 --> 28:53.360
已经俘获了我的心
has captured my special attention.

28:53.570 --> 28:56.280
噢  柯林斯先生
Oh, Mr Collins.

28:56.450 --> 29:00.570
很不幸  我有责任提醒你一下
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

29:00.740 --> 29:07.000
班纳特大小姐很快就要订婚了
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is very soon to be engaged.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.500
订婚
Engaged.

29:08.670 --> 29:09.370
但是伊丽莎白小姐
But Miss Lizzie,

29:09.370 --> 29:11.130
无论是年纪还是美貌  比大小姐都只差一步
next to her in age and beauty,

29:11.340 --> 29:14.760
她定会是个不错的伴侣
would make anyone an excellent partner.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.970
你赞同吗? 柯林斯先生? 
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

29:19.130 --> 29:23.510
当然  当然
Indeed. Indeed.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.180
一个非常好的备选
A very agreeable alternative.

29:48.210 --> 29:51.790
柯林斯先生会让人对全天下的男人丧失信心
Mr Collins is a man who makes you despair at the entire sex.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.030
对你确实是  
Yours, I believe.

29:53.030 --> 29:56.260
韦翰先生  你是多么十全十美阿
Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.630
-他捡起我的手帕  -你是故意丢手帕的? 
- He picked up my handkerchief.  - Did you drop yours on purpose?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.260
韦翰先生是位陆军中尉
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

30:01.430 --> 30:02.900
一位丢了魂的陆军中尉  
An enchanted lieutenant.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.260
你要干什么  丽迪雅? 
What are you up to, Liddy?

30:04.430 --> 30:05.970
我们碰巧来挑丝带  
We happened to be looking for ribbon.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.520
白色的  为舞会准备的
White, for the ball.

30:07.730 --> 30:10.270
我们能一起挑挑丝带吗? 
Shall we all look for some ribbon together?

30:13.400 --> 30:15.110
下午好  詹姆斯先生  
Good afternoon, Mr James.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.820
丽迪雅小姐  班纳特小姐
Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.530
我不该来的
I shan't even browse.

30:18.690 --> 30:21.450
不能指望我  我对丝带毫无鉴赏力
I can't be trusted. I have poor taste in ribbons.

30:21.610 --> 30:24.160
只有真正自信的人才会承认这一点
Only a truly confident man would admit that.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.780
不  我说真的
No, it's true.

30:25.950 --> 30:29.120
还有皮带扣  对于皮带扣  我也一窍不通
And buckles. When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

30:29.290 --> 30:32.710
-军团一定以你为耻  -不  是把我当成笑柄
- You must be the shame of the regiment.  - The laughing stock.

30:32.920 --> 30:36.000
你的上级怎么对你呢? 
What do your superiors do with you?

30:37.460 --> 30:41.680
无视我  我几乎毫无价值  所以无视我就很容易
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance, so it's easily done.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.630
伊丽莎白  借我点钱  
Lizzie, lend me some money.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.010
你欠我的还没还呢
You already owe me a fortune.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.540
请允许我帮个小忙  
Allow me to oblige.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.480
不  韦翰先生  不要...
No, Mr Wickham, please...

30:55.940 --> 30:58.230
我坚持
I insist.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.490
-我真同情那个法国人  -我也是
- I pity the French.  - So do l.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.330
-瞧  彬格莱先生  -彬格莱先生! 
- Look, Mr Bingley.  - Mr Bingley!

31:07.490 --> 31:09.700
我正准备去你们家
I was just on my way to your house.

31:09.910 --> 31:13.000
你喜欢我特地为你的舞会准备的丝带吗? 
How do you like my ribbons for your ball?

31:13.210 --> 31:14.350
非常漂亮  
Very beautiful.

31:14.350 --> 31:16.630
确实  瞧  她是那么的光彩照人
She is. Look, she's blooming.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.420
丽迪雅
Oh, Lydia.

31:18.630 --> 31:22.220
一定要邀请韦翰先生  他是个诚实可靠的人
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham. He is a credit to his profession.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.720
你不能邀请人去别人的舞会
You can't invite people to other people's balls.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.510
当然  你一定要来  韦翰先生
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

31:28.680 --> 31:33.140
失陪了  小姐们  祝你们过得愉快
If you'll excuse me, ladies, enjoy the day.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.070
你打算去尼日斐的舞会吗  韦翰先生? 
Do you plan to go to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

31:39.230 --> 31:44.780
也许会去  达西先生在这里做客多久了? 
Perhaps. How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

31:44.950 --> 31:46.820
大概1个月了
About a month.

31:46.990 --> 31:52.540
请原谅我的冒昧  你和达西先生很熟吗? 
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

31:52.700 --> 31:57.000
实际上  我从小就和他家里有特别的关系
Indeed, I've been connected with his family since infancy.

31:57.210 --> 32:02.090
你一定很惊讶  下午我们见面时那冷冰冰的样子
You may well be surprised, given our cold greeting this afternoon.

32:04.880 --> 32:08.390
你既然有意在麦里屯发展  希望你不要
I hope your plans in favour of Meryton will not be affected

32:08.550 --> 32:11.110
因为你和这位绅士的关系而影响你原来的计划  
by your relations with the gentleman.

32:11.110 --> 32:12.600
我才不会让达西先生赶走呢
It is not for me to be driven away.

32:12.770 --> 32:17.730
要是他不愿意看到我  那该走的是他  而不是我
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go, not l.

32:17.940 --> 32:22.570
我一定要问问  达西先生的什么行为让你如此不快
I must ask, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

32:25.780 --> 32:28.950
我父亲是他家的管家
My father managed his estate.

32:29.160 --> 32:32.330
达西和我从小一起长大
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

32:32.490 --> 32:35.710
他的父亲对待我就好像亲儿子一样
His father treated me like a second son,

32:35.710 --> 32:38.500
像疼爱儿子一样的疼爱我
loved me like a son.

32:38.710 --> 32:41.170
他父亲去世的那天  我们一起
We were both with him the day he died.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.050
守在他的床前到最后一刻
With his last breath,

32:45.220 --> 32:48.390
他父亲的遗嘱上说明把教区牧师职位给我
his father bequeathed me the rectory in his estate.

32:48.590 --> 32:52.180
他早就知道我一心想加入教会
He knew I had my heart set on joining the Church.

32:52.350 --> 32:53.950
但是达西无视他父亲的遗愿
But Darcy ignored his wishes

32:53.950 --> 32:55.680
把那个牧师职位给了别人
and gave the living to another man.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.690
-但为什么呢? -嫉妒
- But why?  - Jealousy.

33:00.690 --> 33:03.320
他的父亲...
His father...

33:03.480 --> 33:06.570
唔  他的父亲疼爱我甚过他  达西无法容忍
Well, he loved me better and Darcy couldn't stand it.

33:07.650 --> 33:08.540
多么残酷阿  
How cruel.

33:08.550 --> 33:10.320
所以到现在我还是个一贫如洗的士兵
So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

33:10.490 --> 33:14.240
低微得引不起任何人的注意
Too lowly even to be noticed.

33:25.880 --> 33:30.260
-摒住呼吸  -我不行了  你弄疼我了
- Breathe in!  - I can't anymore. You're hurting.

33:33.510 --> 33:34.680
伊丽莎白
Betsy.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.430
伊丽莎白! 
Betsy!

33:48.860 --> 33:50.600
那一定是个误会  
There must've been a misunderstanding.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.120
吉英  你从来都不把人往坏处想
Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.870
达西先生怎么会做出那样的事情? 
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

33:57.040 --> 34:00.370
今天晚上我就问问彬格莱先生事情的真相
I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley this evening.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.880
让达西先生自己来辩驳
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.340
除非他解释得通  不然我但愿永远不再见到他
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.800
可怜  不幸的  韦翰先生
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

34:08.010 --> 34:10.130
韦翰比达西更像男子汉
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

34:10.300 --> 34:14.050
但愿他也是个更乐于跳舞的人
And, let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

34:19.310 --> 34:21.100
他们在那  瞧
There they are, look.

34:21.270 --> 34:24.440
-噢  是的  -比利
- Oh, yes.  - Billy.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.160
吉英  马丁在这里
Jane, Martin is here.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.600
能再次见到你真是无比的荣幸
May I say what an immense pleasure it is to see you again.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.860
-班纳特太太  -彬格莱小姐
- Mrs Bennet.  - Miss Bingley.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.070
真迷人
Charming.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.820
我很高兴你能来
I'm so pleased you're here.

35:11.990 --> 35:14.200
我也是
So am I.

35:14.410 --> 35:19.370
你还好吗? 伊丽莎白小姐? 你在找人吗? 
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth? Are you looking for someone?

35:19.580 --> 35:24.040
不  不是  我只是惊叹这里如此光彩壮丽
No, not at all, I was just admiring the general splendour.

35:24.210 --> 35:27.960
-令人叹为观止  彬格莱先生  -太好了
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.  - Good.

35:35.890 --> 35:40.600
你也许已经和彬格莱先生打趣过了
You might have passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

35:40.770 --> 35:44.520
我一生从没见过这么令人愉快的绅士
I've never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

35:44.730 --> 35:47.190
你看到他多么喜爱她吗? 
Did you see how he dotes on her?

35:47.360 --> 35:52.070
亲爱的吉英  总是为家人打算
Dear Jane, always doing what's best for her family.

36:09.590 --> 36:11.550
-夏洛特! -伊丽莎白! 
- Charlotte!  - Lizzie!

36:11.710 --> 36:14.400
你有看到韦翰先生吗? 
Have you seen Mr Wickham?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.510
没有  可能他来过这
No. Perhaps he's through here.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.920
伊丽莎白  韦翰先生不在这
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.070
显然  他被事情耽误了
Apparently, he's been detained.

36:33.280 --> 36:36.530
在哪耽误? 他一定在这
Detained where? He must be here.

36:36.740 --> 36:40.950
-你在这啊  -柯林斯先生
- There you are.  - Mr Collins.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.620
你能赏脸和我跳舞吗? 伊丽莎白小姐
Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth.

36:44.830 --> 36:48.920
噢  我没想到你会跳舞  柯林斯先生
Oh, I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

36:49.080 --> 36:53.630
我认为这和牧师的职责不相违背
I do not think it incompatible with the office of a clergyman.

36:53.800 --> 36:57.220
相反  有些人  包括贵妇人们在内都称赞
Several people, her Ladyship included, have complimented me

36:57.380 --> 37:01.050
我轻盈的舞步呢
on my lightness of foot.

37:25.700 --> 37:30.420
显然  你的韦翰先生有事上城里去了
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town.

37:33.750 --> 37:37.800
跳舞对我来说影响不大  但是...
Dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does...

37:37.970 --> 37:41.550
它为慷慨给予了机会...
...but it does afford the opportunity to lavish...

37:45.520 --> 37:48.380
...取决于舞伴的注意力...  
... upon one's partner attentions...

37:48.390 --> 37:49.890
有人告诉我...
My informer tells me...

37:50.100 --> 37:55.150
韦翰先生要不是为了要回避这儿的某一位先生
that he would be less inclined to be engaged, were it not for...

37:55.360 --> 37:57.570
决不会这么凑巧  偏偏这个时候因事缺席
...the presence of a certain gentleman.

37:57.780 --> 37:59.820
谁是我的第一舞伴
Which is my primary object.

38:00.030 --> 38:02.820
不用说也知道那位绅士是谁
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.910
请恕我冒昧  我是有意为之
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

38:06.080 --> 38:08.620
整晚与你保持亲密
to remain close to you throughout the evening.

38:23.090 --> 38:25.470
我能和你跳下一支舞吗? 伊丽莎白小姐
May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?

38:25.680 --> 38:27.560
可以
You may.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.690
我居然同意和达西先生跳舞了? 
Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?

38:39.690 --> 38:41.820
你将来一定会发觉他很讨人喜欢的
I dare say you will find him amiable.

38:41.990 --> 38:47.040
那一定非常难  因为我发誓一辈子讨厌他
It would be most inconvenient since I've sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

39:02.010 --> 39:05.850
-我爱这支舞曲  -确实  非常令人鼓舞
- I love this dance.  - Indeed. Most invigorating.

39:09.970 --> 39:12.440
现在该轮到你说点什么啦  达西先生
It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.400
我既然谈了舞曲
I talked about the dance.

39:15.560 --> 39:20.440
你就得谈谈舞池的大小以及有多少舞伴之类的问题
Now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.

39:20.610 --> 39:24.700
乐意遵命  你最想听什么? 
I'm perfectly happy to oblige. What would you like most to hear?

39:24.860 --> 39:27.160
这个回答眼前也说得过去了
That reply will do for present.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.540
待一会我或许会谈到
Perhaps by and by I may observe

39:32.750 --> 39:35.920
私人舞会比公共场所的舞会更好
that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.670
不过  我们现在可以不必作声了
For now, we may remain silent.

39:49.390 --> 39:52.480
那么说  你跳起舞来照例总得要谈上几句吗? 
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

39:52.680 --> 39:56.520
不  不  我更喜欢不爱交际和沉默
No. No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.

40:00.530 --> 40:03.950
这样会让别人更愉快  你不觉得吗? 
Makes it all so much more enjoyable, don't you think?

40:06.320 --> 40:10.240
告诉我  你和你的姐妹们经常上麦里屯溜达吗? 
Tell me, do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton?

40:12.950 --> 40:16.370
是的  我们常常去
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.500
那是结识新朋友的好机会
It's a great opportunity to meet new people.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.270
你那天在那儿碰到我们的时候
When you met us,

40:23.270 --> 40:25.300
我们正在结交一个新朋友呢
we'd just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

40:27.180 --> 40:31.390
韦翰先生生来满面春风  交起朋友来得心应手
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy manners, he's sure of making friends.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.310
至于他是不是能和朋友们长久相处  那就未必了
Whether he's capable of retaining them is less so.

40:34.480 --> 40:40.230
他真不幸  竟失去了您的友谊  不可挽回了吗? 
He's been so unfortunate as to lose your friendship. That is irreversible?

40:40.440 --> 40:42.500
是的  你问我这些话用意何在? 
It is. Why do you ask such a question?

40:42.510 --> 40:44.570
只不过为了要了解了解你的性格罢了
To make out your character.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.190
那么你究竟弄明白了没有? 
What have you discovered?

40:46.190 --> 40:47.200
我一点儿也弄不明白
Very little.

40:47.450 --> 40:49.260
我听到人家对于你的看法并不一致
I hear such different accounts of you

40:49.260 --> 40:50.950
叫我不知道相信谁的话才好
as puzzle me exceedingly.

40:52.330 --> 40:54.870
我希望将来我能让你对我有更清晰的认识
I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.700
那是彭伯里庄园的达西先生吗? 
Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?

41:43.700 --> 41:44.420
我想是的
I believe so.

41:44.590 --> 41:46.380
我一定要向达西先生自我介绍
I must make myself known to him.

41:46.550 --> 41:49.470
他是我的女资助人凯瑟琳夫人的侄儿
He's a nephew of my patroness, Lady Catherine.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.600
他会认为那是很冒失的行为
He will consider it an impertinence.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.310
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

41:55.470 --> 41:57.600
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

41:58.680 --> 42:03.480
达西先生  晚上好...
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

42:03.690 --> 42:06.610
你的亲戚多么有趣啊
What interesting relatives you have.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.840
曼丽  亲爱的  你使我们开心得够久啦
Mary, dear, you've delighted us long enough.

42:28.050 --> 42:31.380
留点时间给别的小姐们表演表演吧
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

42:34.390 --> 42:37.100
...当我还是孩子的时候  她就去世了
...since I was a child, and then she died.

42:37.260 --> 42:38.970
我有漂亮的灰色
I have a beautiful grey.

42:39.180 --> 42:43.020
当然  卡罗琳的马术比我好  绝对
Of course, Caroline's a much better rider than l, of course.

42:46.980 --> 42:51.360
噢  是的  我们热切期盼着这门好处多多的婚事
Oh, yes. We fully expect a most advantageous marriage.

42:52.530 --> 42:54.440
如果我的吉英能攀得这么称心如意的姻缘
And my Jane, marrying so grand,

42:54.440 --> 42:56.660
那么  她的妹妹们也就有希望碰上别的阔少
must throw her sisters in the way.

43:18.810 --> 43:23.850
显然我们家像是约定今天晚上到这儿来尽量出丑的
Clearly my family are seeing who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.

43:24.060 --> 43:27.980
-至少  彬格莱先生没有注意到  -没有
- At least Bingley has not noticed.  - No.

43:28.150 --> 43:31.650
-我想他真的很喜欢她  -但是她喜欢他吗? 
- I think he likes her very much.  - But does she like him?

43:31.820 --> 43:35.950
几乎没有人能够不仰赖适当的鼓励而陷入爱河
Few of us are secure enough to be in love without proper encouragement.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.490
彬格莱非常喜欢她
Bingley likes her enormously,

43:38.700 --> 43:41.410
但是可能以后不会了  如果她还不帮帮他
but might not do more if she does not help him on.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.300
她只是害羞
She's just shy.

43:42.300 --> 43:45.330
如果他感觉不到她的关心  他一定是个傻瓜
If he cannot perceive her regard, he is a fool.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.960
陷入爱河的人都是傻瓜
We are all fools in love.

43:48.130 --> 43:51.130
他不像我们那么了解她的性格
He does not know her character as we do.

43:51.340 --> 43:53.720
她应该尽快把他弄到手
She should move fast and snap him up.

43:53.880 --> 43:57.300
我们以后有的是时间来了解他
There is plenty of time for us to get to know him afterwards.

43:58.600 --> 44:02.430
我觉得有人会放出小猪来
I can't help feeling that someone's going to produce a piglet

44:02.600 --> 44:04.560
让我们来追赶
and make us chase it.

44:11.780 --> 44:15.030
-噢  亲爱的! -我很抱歉  先生
- Oh, dear!  - I do apologise, sir.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.160
我真的很抱歉  请原谅我
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.930
艾米莉  不要! 
Emily, please!

44:42.350 --> 44:43.950
曼丽  我亲爱的曼丽
Mary, my dear Mary.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.810
噢亲爱的  噢亲爱的  噢亲爱的
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

44:46.980 --> 44:50.150
-我整整一星期都在练  -我知道  亲爱的
- I've been practising all week.  - I know, my dear.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.730
我讨厌舞会
I hate balls.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.000
班纳特老爷  醒醒
Mr Bennet, wake up.

45:14.170 --> 45:18.880
噢  我从没玩得这么尽兴过
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

45:21.260 --> 45:23.640
查尔斯  你不会是认真的吧
Charles, you cannot be serious.

45:30.730 --> 45:36.240
班纳特先生  不出3个月我们就要办场婚事啦
We'll have a wedding here in less than three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

45:38.990 --> 45:40.570
班纳特老爷! 
Mr Bennet!

45:46.290 --> 45:49.000
曼丽  拜托
Mary, please.

45:57.090 --> 45:59.380
谢谢  希尔先生
Thank you, Mr Hill.

46:17.070 --> 46:20.150
班纳特太太  如果不麻烦的话
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping, if it would not trouble you,

46:20.360 --> 46:24.990
能让我和伊丽莎白小姐单独谈谈吗
that I might solicit a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

46:25.200 --> 46:30.870
噢  当然可以  伊丽莎白会很乐意的
Oh, certainly, Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.420
大家都出去  柯林斯先生想和你们的姐姐单独谈谈
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister.

46:35.630 --> 46:38.440
等等  柯林斯先生没有什么不可告人的话
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing

46:38.440 --> 46:40.010
非要单独和我说的
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

46:40.220 --> 46:44.140
我要你待在这儿别动  其他所有人都去客厅
I desire you will stay where you are. Everyone else to the drawing room.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.850
-班纳特老爷  -但是...
- Mr Bennet.  - But...

46:46.010 --> 46:48.390
马上
Now.

46:49.390 --> 46:54.190
-吉英  吉英  别...吉英! -吉英
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!  - Jane.

46:56.860 --> 46:59.940
爸爸  留下
Papa, stay.

47:26.390 --> 47:28.100
亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

47:28.310 --> 47:31.890
我对你的百般殷勤  已经表现得非常明显了
My attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.480
几乎是当我走进这房子的那一刻
Almost as soon as I entered the house,

47:34.690 --> 47:39.820
我就挑中你做我的终身伴侣
I singled you out as the companion of my future life.

47:40.030 --> 47:42.690
趁我现在还控制得住我自己感情的时候
But before I am run away with my feelings,

47:42.860 --> 47:45.610
先陈述一下我要结婚的理由
perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.240
第一  这是牧师的职责
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

47:48.410 --> 47:51.080
给全教区树立一个婚姻的好榜样
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

47:51.250 --> 47:55.250
其次  我深信结婚会大大地增进我的幸福
Secondly, I am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness.

47:55.420 --> 47:58.340
第三  我尊敬的女资助人
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

47:58.500 --> 48:02.090
凯瑟琳夫人催促我
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

48:02.260 --> 48:04.630
挑选一个好太太
that I select a wife.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.930
我来浪博恩的目的就是
My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one

48:08.100 --> 48:10.140
从班纳特先生的女儿中挑选一个做太太
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

48:10.310 --> 48:13.230
因为我将要继承令尊的财产
for I am to inherit the estate

48:13.390 --> 48:16.560
而像这样的结合一定...
and such an alliance will surely...

48:17.770 --> 48:19.650
...会让每个人满意
...suit everyone.

48:21.820 --> 48:26.360
现在我只能用最激动的语言
And now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language

48:26.530 --> 48:28.230
把我最热烈的感情向你倾诉  
of the violence of my affections.

48:28.230 --> 48:29.070
柯林斯先生! 
Mr Collins!

48:29.280 --> 48:31.410
对于财产的有限  没有任何责备的意思
And no reproach on the subject of fortune

48:31.620 --> 48:34.400
我们结婚以后  我决不会说一句小气话  
will cross my lips once we're married.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.250
你忘了我根本没有回答你呢
You forget I have given no answer.

48:36.420 --> 48:40.000
凯瑟琳夫人定会赞同这门婚事  只要我向她说说
Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve when I speak to her

48:40.170 --> 48:45.300
你的淑静  节约以及其他种种可爱的优点
of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.

48:45.470 --> 48:47.580
先生  你的求婚使我感到荣幸
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,

48:47.580 --> 48:50.180
可惜我除了谢绝别无他法
but I regret that I must decline it.

48:51.350 --> 48:55.270
我知道  小姐们都会矜持推诿一下...
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

48:55.480 --> 48:57.820
柯林斯先生  我的谢绝完全是认真的
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.

48:57.830 --> 48:59.150
你不能使我幸福
You could not make me happy.

48:59.310 --> 49:02.980
而且我也绝对不能使你幸福
And I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.650
说句自不量力的话
I flatter myself

49:04.650 --> 49:07.740
你的拒绝不过是女人家微妙的天性
that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy.

49:07.900 --> 49:10.740
此外  尽管你有许多吸引人的地方
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

49:10.910 --> 49:15.200
但恐怕也不会有别人会向你求婚了
it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you.

49:15.410 --> 49:16.380
我就不得不认为
I must conclude

49:16.380 --> 49:19.000
你这样是欲擒故纵  想要更加博得我的喜爱
that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense,

49:19.210 --> 49:23.590
仿效一般高贵的女性的通例
according to the usual practice of elegant females.

49:23.750 --> 49:27.340
我不是那种故意捉弄尊敬绅士的女性
I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man.

49:27.510 --> 49:30.050
请理解我  我不能接受你
Please understand me, I cannot accept you.

49:37.310 --> 49:40.480
顽固的傻孩子
Headstrong, foolish child.

49:48.450 --> 49:54.370
别担心  柯林斯先生  我们马上就能解决这一切
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this little hiccup dealt with immediately.

49:55.490 --> 49:59.000
伊丽莎白  伊丽莎白! 
Lizzie. Lizzie!

50:03.130 --> 50:07.420
班纳特老爷  家里都闹翻天了! 
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

50:07.630 --> 50:11.300
你得来劝劝伊丽莎白嫁给柯林斯先生
You must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

50:11.470 --> 50:13.930
柯林斯先生已经向伊丽莎白求婚了
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

50:14.140 --> 50:17.720
但是她发誓不要他  现在危险的是
but she vowed she will not have him, and now the danger is

50:17.890 --> 50:20.730
柯林斯先生会不要伊丽莎白了
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

50:20.890 --> 50:25.520
-我能做什么? -唔  过来和她谈谈
- What am I to do?  - Well, come and talk to her.

50:25.690 --> 50:26.860
马上! 
Now!

50:39.540 --> 50:41.760
告诉她  你非要她嫁给他不可  
Tell her you insist they marry.

50:41.760 --> 50:42.620
爸爸  不要
Papa, please.

50:42.790 --> 50:46.880
你将拥有这栋房子  还能让妹妹们免于受穷
You will have this house and save your sisters from destitution.

50:47.050 --> 50:48.280
我不能嫁给他  
I can't marry him.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.010
现在就回去告诉他  你已经改变了心意
Go back now and say you've changed your mind.

50:50.170 --> 50:52.720
-为你的家人想想  -你不能逼我
- Think of your family.  - You cannot make me.

50:52.880 --> 50:55.430
班纳特老爷  你倒是说点什么呀
Mr Bennet, say something.

50:59.350 --> 51:02.690
你母亲坚持要你嫁给柯林斯先生
Your mother insists upon you marrying Mr Collins.

51:02.890 --> 51:05.610
是的  否则我就再也不要见她了
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

51:05.770 --> 51:09.780
从今天起  你不和父亲绝交  就要和母亲绝交
From this day onward, you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.400
当你父亲去世了  谁会养你? 
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

51:12.610 --> 51:14.370
要是你不嫁给柯林斯先生
Your mother will never see you again

51:14.370 --> 51:16.450
你的母亲就再不要见你了
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

51:16.620 --> 51:19.790
如果你嫁给他  我就再不要见你了
and I will never see you again if you do.

51:19.950 --> 51:21.580
谢谢  爸爸
Thank you, Papa.

51:25.330 --> 51:29.960
忘恩负义的孩子! 我再也不理你了
Ungrateful child! I shall never speak to you again.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.840
我现在都没什么兴致说话了
Not that I take much pleasure in talking.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.590
象我这样神经脆弱的人
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints

51:36.760 --> 51:39.760
就没有多大的兴致说话
can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.

51:39.970 --> 51:41.680
吉英! 
Jane!

51:44.980 --> 51:49.110
出什么事了? 吉英? 
What's the matter? Jane?

51:50.280 --> 51:52.910
致:赫特福德郡浪博恩
吉英·班纳特小姐

52:43.620 --> 52:47.040
我不明白是什么让他离开尼日斐花园
I don't understand what would take him from Netherfield.

52:47.210 --> 52:49.500
为什么他不知道什么时候会回来呢? 
Why does he not know when he'll return?

52:49.670 --> 52:50.840
读读
Read it.

53:00.090 --> 53:02.350
"达西先生迫不急待地要去看看他的妹妹
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister

53:02.350 --> 53:04.720
我们也几乎同样热切地希望和她重逢
and we are scarcely less eager.

53:04.930 --> 53:07.850
我认为乔治安娜·达西无论在容貌
I do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,

53:08.020 --> 53:10.400
举止还是才艺方面都无人能及
elegance and accomplishment.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.940
希望她以后会做我的嫂嫂"
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

53:12.110 --> 53:14.820
说得还不够清楚吗? 
Is that not clear enough?

53:14.980 --> 53:17.700
卡罗琳看出她哥哥爱上你
Caroline sees her brother in love with you

53:17.860 --> 53:20.530
就把他带走  想方设法去说服他
and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.

53:20.700 --> 53:25.660
但是我知道她不可能想骗谁就骗谁
But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.830
看上去他好像真的不爱我了  
It's more likely he does not love me.

53:28.830 --> 53:30.500
他爱你  别放弃
He loves you. Do not give up.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.750
去我们在伦敦的舅舅家
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

53:34.960 --> 53:38.550
让他知道你在那  我敢肯定他会来看你的
Let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.

53:48.140 --> 53:49.900
请将我的爱赐予我的姐姐
Give my love to my sister

53:49.900 --> 53:52.770
让我的爱不要成为她的负担  亲爱的
and try not to be a burden, dear.

53:52.940 --> 53:55.400
可怜的吉英
Poor Jane.

53:55.610 --> 53:59.990
然而  女孩子总是喜欢被爱
Still, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.540
这起码可以给她一些事情去思考
It gives her something to think of

54:02.710 --> 54:05.880
也可以使她觉得与其它同伴不同
and a sort of distinction amongst her companions.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.360
我相信那会令她振奋起来的  爸爸  
I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.920
现在轮到你了  伊丽莎白
It's your turn now, Lizzie.

54:10.130 --> 54:12.010
你已经拒绝了柯林斯
You've turned down Collins.

54:12.170 --> 54:16.470
你现在是自由身了  自己成了甩别人的小姐了
You're free to go off and be jilted yourself.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.510
韦翰先生怎么样? 
What about Mr Wickham?

54:18.680 --> 54:21.470
他是一位不错的年轻人  相信也靠得住
He's a pleasant fellow and he'd do the job credibly.

54:21.640 --> 54:25.310
-父亲...  -而且你有一个亲爱的母亲
- Father...  - And you have an affectionate mother

54:25.520 --> 54:29.110
她绝不会放弃这个机会的
who would make the most of it.

54:48.540 --> 54:50.670
-夏洛特! -我亲爱的伊丽莎白
- Charlotte!  - My dear Lizzie.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.540
我来告诉你一个重要的消息
I've come here to tell you the news.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.380
柯林斯先生和我...订婚了
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

54:56.550 --> 54:58.850
-订婚了? -是的
- Engaged?  - Yes.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.480
为了结婚的订婚? 
To be married?

55:05.490 --> 55:08.350
除此之外  还会有其他的类型的订婚么? 
What other kind of engaged is there?

55:09.730 --> 55:13.150
看在上天的份上  伊丽莎白  别那样看着我
For heaven's sake, Lizzie, don't look at me like that.

55:13.320 --> 55:16.320
嫁给他和嫁给其他任何人对我来说都一样开心
I should be as happy with him as any other.

55:16.530 --> 55:19.320
-但是他的人十分荒谬  -噢  不要这么说
- But he's ridiculous.  - Oh, hush.

55:19.490 --> 55:23.240
并不是所有的人都能拥有浪漫
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

55:23.410 --> 55:27.250
他能给我一个舒适安全的家
I've been offered a comfortable home and protection.

55:27.420 --> 55:29.130
值得我感激的已经够多了
There's a lot to be thankful for.

55:29.330 --> 55:34.760
我已经27岁了  我没有钱  也没什么前途
I'm 27 years old. I've no money and no prospects.

55:34.920 --> 55:38.510
我已经成了父母的包袱了
I'm already a burden to my parents.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.140
而且  我害怕了
And I'm frightened.

55:41.300 --> 55:45.850
所以  请不要评判我  伊丽莎白  别评判我
So don't judge me, Lizzie. Don't you dare judge me.

56:38.360 --> 56:41.200
亲爱的夏洛特  谢谢你的来信
Dear Charlotte, thank you for your letter.

56:42.530 --> 56:45.700
很高兴你对你的房子  家具以及舍路都满意
I'm glad the house, furniture and roads are to your taste,

56:45.870 --> 56:49.290
也高兴得知那位凯瑟琳女士对你友好和蔼
and that Lady Catherine's behaviour is friendly and obliging.

56:49.460 --> 56:52.130
你走了  吉英去了伦敦
What with your departure, Jane's to London

56:52.290 --> 56:55.800
有趣的韦翰先生随民兵团去了北方
and the militia to the North with the colourful Mr Wickham,

56:55.960 --> 56:59.880
我必须承认  现在我眼前的景色变得有点灰暗了
I must confess, the view from where I sit has been rather grey.

57:00.090 --> 57:03.050
至于你的请求  根本算不上是请求
As for the favour you ask, it is no favour at all.

57:03.220 --> 57:07.350
我会非常高兴尽早来探望你
I would be happy to visit you at your earliest convenience.

57:14.060 --> 57:16.110
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to our humble abode.

57:21.450 --> 57:25.200
为了我的健康  我的妻子鼓励我花点时间在花园里面
My wife encourages me to spend time in the garden for my health.

57:25.370 --> 57:27.740
我想我们的客人在旅途后已经感到疲惫了
I think our guest is tired after her journey.

57:27.950 --> 57:29.450
我计划了很多改进的方案
I plan many improvements.

57:29.450 --> 57:32.580
我打算要去掉一些大树桩然后在走道旁种上酸橙树
I intend to throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

57:32.750 --> 57:33.700
说句自不量力的话
I flatter myself

57:33.700 --> 57:35.710
任何一个年轻女士都会
that any young lady would be happy

57:35.880 --> 57:38.880
为能成为这座房子的主妇而感到高兴的
to be the mistress of such a house.

57:40.050 --> 57:41.920
在这里没人打扰
We shan't be disturbed here.

57:42.130 --> 57:45.970
这间工作室是我专用的
This parlour is for my own particular use.

57:48.720 --> 57:52.810
伊丽莎白  能打理自己的家真是件高兴的事情
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure to run my own home.

57:52.980 --> 57:55.980
-夏洛特  过来! -发生什么事了? 
- Charlotte, come here!  - What's happened?

57:56.150 --> 58:00.150
猪又跑了吗? 噢  是凯瑟琳夫人
Has the pig escaped again? Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.860
过来看看  伊丽莎白
Come and see, Lizzie.

58:03.030 --> 58:05.660
好消息
Great news.

58:05.820 --> 58:09.080
凯瑟琳女士邀请我们去罗新斯花园
We received an invitation to Rosings from Lady Catherine.

58:09.240 --> 58:10.790
实在太好了! 
How wonderful!

58:10.950 --> 58:13.960
千万不要为你的衣着担心
Do not make yourself uneasy about your apparel.

58:14.170 --> 58:16.460
穿上你带来的最好的衣服就行了
Just put on the best you've brought.

58:16.630 --> 58:21.170
凯瑟琳夫人从来都不会嫌弃简陋
Lady Catherine's never been averse to the truly humble.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.470
全欧洲最非凡的景色之一
One of the most extraordinary sights in all of Europe.

58:25.680 --> 58:29.180
光是玻璃窗就花了两万英镑
The glazing alone costs upwards of ￡20,000.

58:29.390 --> 58:31.930
跟着来  跟紧
Come along. Come along.

58:40.730 --> 58:43.650
晚点我们会玩扑克牌
A little later we'll play cards.

58:44.700 --> 58:47.490
尊贵的夫人
Your Ladyship.

58:47.660 --> 58:50.660
德·包尔小姐
Miss de Bourgh.

59:09.050 --> 59:11.310
那么  你是伊丽莎白·班纳特? 
So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?

59:11.310 --> 59:12.560
是的  尊贵的夫人
I am, your Ladyship.

59:16.230 --> 59:18.690
这是我的女儿
This is my daughter.

59:20.820 --> 59:22.900
感谢你邀请我们一同进餐
It's kind of you to ask us to dine.

59:22.900 --> 59:25.360
单这地毯就起码要300英镑
The rug alone cost upwards of ￡300.

59:27.150 --> 59:29.280
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

59:30.700 --> 59:32.740
你怎么会在这里? 
What are you doing here?

59:34.870 --> 59:38.370
达西先生  没想到会有幸遇到你
Mr Darcy, I had no idea we had the honour.

59:40.130 --> 59:43.680
伊丽莎白小姐  我是来这做客的  
Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.260
你认识我的侄子? 
You know my nephew?

59:46.920 --> 59:50.340
是的  在赫特福德郡  我有幸遇见你的侄子
I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

59:50.550 --> 59:53.260
我是费茨威廉上校  你好
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

59:58.810 --> 01:00:02.740
柯林斯先生  你不能坐在你妻子的旁边
Mr Collins, you can't sit next to your wife.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.820
换个位置  到那边去
Move. Over there.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:24.880
哈维  我想你能不能给我那道鱼的菜...
Harvey, I wonder, could you get me the fish course...

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:29.130
我想你们一家身体都健康吧  伊丽莎白小姐? 
I trust your family is in good health, Miss Elizabeth?

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.260
是的  谢谢
They are, thank you.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:37.980
我大姐在伦敦  可能你在那里见过她了
My eldest sister is in London. Perhaps you saw her there.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.140
我还未有幸能...
I haven't been fortunate enough...

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:44.730
你会弹钢琴吗  班纳特小姐? 
Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.930
只会一点点  夫人  弹得不怎么样  
A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.360
你会绘画吗? 
Do you draw?

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.780
不  一点都不会
No, not at all.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.200
你的姐妹呢? 她们会绘画吗? 
Your sisters, do they draw?

01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:56.700
没有一个会
Not one.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.370
这倒很稀奇
That's very strange.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.170
我猜你们是没机会学吧
I suppose you had no opportunity.

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:05.250
你们的母亲应该带你们去城里面投名师才对
Your mother should've taken you to town for the benefit of the masters.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.550
我母亲是不会反对  可是我父亲讨厌城里
My mother wouldn't have minded, but my father hates town.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.430
你们的女家庭教师走了吗? 
Has your governess left you?

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.140
我们从来没有请过女家庭教师
We never had a governess.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.790
没有女家庭教师? 
No governess?

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.810
家里教养着五个女儿  却不请个女教庭教师? 
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess?

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.830
我简直闻所未闻
I never heard such a thing.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:23.100
你母亲亲自教育你们  一定累得如同奴隶一般
Your mother must've been a slave to your education.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.310
凯瑟琳夫人  事实并非如此
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.610
你的妹妹们有没有哪一个已经出来参加社交了? 
Your younger sisters, are they out in society?

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.950
-有  太太  全都出来社交了  -全部? 
- Yes, ma'am, all.  - All?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.120
什么  五个姐妹同时出来社交? 真奇怪
What, all five out at once? That's very odd.

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:39.180
你排行第二
And you second.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.040
姐姐还没嫁人  妹妹就出来社交? 
The younger ones out before the elders are married?

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.710
你妹妹们一定还很小吧
Your youngest sisters must be very young.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.590
是的  最小的还没到16岁
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.670
如果年少的妹妹因为年长的姐姐
But it would be hard on younger sisters

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.510
没有结婚而不能进行社交活动
not to have their amusement because the elder is still unmarried.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.680
这一点都不会增进姐妹感情
It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:02.810
真想不到  你这么年轻  倒挺有主见啊
Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.690
请问  你几岁啦? 
Pray, what is your age?

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.480
我已经有了三个成人的妹妹
With three younger sisters grown up,

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.780
你老人家总不会再要我招出年纪来吧
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:22.040
过来  班纳特小姐  为我们弹奏一曲
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.540
-不  请饶了我吧  -音乐会使我高兴
- No, I beg you.  - For music is my delight.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.000
实际上目前在英国  没有几个人能像我一样
In fact, there are few people in England

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:33.090
真正欣赏音乐
who have more true enjoyment of music.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.840
也没有人比我趣味更高
Or better natural taste.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.390
我要是学了音乐  一定会成为一个名家
If I had ever learnt, I should've been a great proficient.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.730
安娜要是身体好  也一定会成为一个名家的
So would Anne, if her health would've allowed her.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.110
我不是假装谦虚  当我说我差的时候...
I'm not afflicted with false modesty, when I say I play poorly...

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:54.030
过来  伊丽莎白  尊贵的夫人要你弹
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:19.140
乔治安娜现在学得怎么样啦  达西? 
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.770
-她弹得非常好  -我希望她有常练习
- She plays very well.  - I hope she practises.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:26.190
卓越的技能无一例外需要持久的练习
No excellence can be acquired without constant practice.

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:28.810
我对柯林斯夫人说过
I've told Mrs Collins this.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.440
虽然你没有琴  也十分欢迎你来罗新斯花园
Though you have no instrument, you're welcome to come to Rosings

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.610
在管家的房间里面弹钢琴
and play on the pianoforte in the housekeeper's room.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.660
你在那里不会妨碍任何人
You'll be in nobody's way in that part of the house.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:52.000
你这样走过来听  莫不是想吓唬我? 
You mean to frighten me by coming in all your state to hear me.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.090
尽管你妹妹的确演奏得很好  我也不怕
But I won't be alarmed, even if your sister does play so well.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:00.180
就算想吓唬你  我知道是没法如愿的
I know that I cannot alarm you even should I wish it.

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:04.310
我的朋友在赫特福德郡表现得怎么样? 
What was my friend like in Hertfordshire?

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.520
你真的想知道? 
You really care to know?

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.900
我先得请你不要害怕
Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:14.110
当我第一次见到他时  他不和任何人跳舞
The first time I saw him, he danced with nobody,

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.900
尽管男客很少
though gentlemen were scarce

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:18.860
当时在场的不少女客没有舞伴而闲坐一旁
and there was more than one lady without a partner.

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.220
当时舞会上除了自己人  我谁都不认识  
I knew nobody beyond my own party.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.780
舞会里是不兴请人介绍女伴的
Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.700
费茨威廉  过来
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.050
我没有那种本领
I do not have the talent

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.590
能跟新认识的人也谈笑风生
of conversing easily with people I have never met before.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:46.680
也许你应该听从你姑妈的意见多练习
Perhaps you should take your aunt's advice and practise.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.540
亲爱的吉英...
Dear Jane...

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:23.890
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:33.270
请  请坐
Please, do be seated.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.700
柯林斯夫妇到村里去了
Mr and Mrs Collins have gone to the village.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.540
这是座迷人的房子
This is a charming house.

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:53.410
我相信柯林斯先生初到这的时候
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:56.080
凯瑟琳夫人一定在这上面费了好大一番心思吧
when Mr Collins first arrived.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.630
我相信她的确费了一番心思
I believe so.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.310
她的好心并没有白费
She could not have bestowed her kindness

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:05.050
因为没人能比柯林斯先生更感恩戴德了
on a more grateful subject.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.810
-需要为你叫一杯茶么? -不用了  谢谢
- Shall I call for some tea?  - No, thank you.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.650
祝你愉快  伊丽莎白小姐  与你聊天很愉快
Good day, Miss Elizabeth, it's been a pleasure.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.660
你对可怜的达西先生到底做了什么啊? 
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.210
我一点头绪都没有
I have no idea.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.130
每个灵魂都需要安抚者
Every mind must have some counsellor

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.970
在悲痛中能安抚你
to whom it may apply for consolation in distress.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:46.820
还有其他很多便利是别人能给予
There are many conveniences which others can supply

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.930
但是我们无法提供的
and we cannot procure.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.970
以我的观点看来  那些便利
I have in view those objects

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.270
是需要通过交流来获得的...
which are only to be obtained through intercourse...

01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:01.860
请原谅  从友谊和礼节上的交流
Forgive me, through the intercourse of friendship or civility.

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.690
在那种情况下  骄傲的人主动与你接触
On such occasions, the proud man steps forth to meet you

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:07.820
不是出于他的诚恳
not with cordiality,

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:12.830
而是出于一个像对敌人般的怀疑...
but with the suspicion of one who reconnoitres an enemy...

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.620
-你打算住多久  -达西住多久我就住多久
- How long do you plan to stay?  - As long as Darcy chooses.

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:20.040
-我得听他调遣  -看起来每个人都是如此
- I am at his disposal.  - Everyone appears to be.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.500
我不懂他为什么不还不结婚
I wonder he does not marry

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.960
结了婚不就可以有个人一辈子听他摆布了吗? 
and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:26.990
能成为达西太太  是件幸运的事  
She would be a lucky woman.

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.930
真的吗? 
Really?

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.220
达西是一个对同伴最忠诚的人
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:34.850
他最近才拯救了他的一个朋友
He recently came to the rescue of one of his friends.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.440
发生了什么事? 
What happened?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.730
他把他的朋友从一门鲁莽的婚事中拯救出来
He saved him from an imprudent marriage.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.110
那个人是谁? 
Who's the man?

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.450
他最亲近的朋友  查尔斯·彬格莱
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:54.790
达西先生有没有说  他为什么要管人家闲事? 
Did Mr Darcy give a reason for this interference?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.120
那位小姐有些条件不大够格
There were apparently strong objections to the lady.

01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:01.590
什么条件? 不富裕? 
What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:06.010
我想是她的家庭被认为是门不当户不对的
I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.680
所以他就去拆散他们? 
So he separated them?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.260
我想是的  我就知道这些
I believe so. I know nothing else.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.170
伊丽莎白小姐
Miss Elizabeth.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.960
我实在没有办法撑下去了
I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer.

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.290
这几个月对于我来说是一种折磨
These past months have been a torment.

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.300
我来罗新斯只是为了见你
I came to Rosings only to see you.

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:54.640
理智的想法和家族的期望阻挠着我
I have fought against judgement, my family's expectation,

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:57.680
你卑微的出身和我爵位的悬殊也令我迟疑不决
the inferiority of your birth, my rank.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.480
但我要把这一切统统抛开  请你终结我的痛苦
I will put them aside and ask you to end my agony.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.810
-我不明白你在说什么  -我爱你
- I don't understand.  - I love you.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.320
最真挚的爱
Most ardently.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:15.490
请赐予我荣幸  接受我的手吧
Please do me the honour of accepting my hand.

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:20.830
先生  我感激你的挣扎
Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through,

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.580
很抱歉引起你的痛苦
and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:25.840
我完全是无心的
It was unconsciously done.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.050
-这就是你的回复? -是的  先生
- Is this your reply?  - Yes, sir.

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.930
-你是在嘲笑我吗? -不
- Are you laughing at me?  - No.

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.260
你是在拒绝我? 
Are you rejecting me?

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:39.020
我确信  你心中阶级的门槛会帮助你克服痛苦
I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.350
我能否问问  为什么我竟会遭受如此无礼的拒绝? 
Might I ask why with so little civility I am thus repulsed?

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.860
那么我能否问问
I might enquire

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:47.770
为什么你说喜欢我是违背了你自己的理智? 
why you told me you liked me against your better judgement?

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:48.680
若说我是无礼的
If I was uncivil,

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.240
那这就是我无礼的理由之一吧
then that is some excuse.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.410
-但我还有别的理由  -什么理由? 
- But you know I have other reasons.  - What reasons?

01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:57.160
一个毁了我最亲爱的姐姐幸福的人
Do you think anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:00.500
怎么会打动我的心去爱他呢? 
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:05.380
你能否认你拆散了一对相爱的恋人
Do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other,

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.920
让你的朋友被大家指责为朝三暮四
exposing your friend to censure for caprice

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.920
让我的姐姐被大家嘲笑为奢望空想
and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes,

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:13.130
让他们双方都受尽了痛苦? 
involving them both in acute misery?

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.760
-我并不否认  -你怎么能做出这样的事情? 
- I do not deny it.  - How could you do it?

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.810
我认为你姐姐觉得他无关紧要
I believed your sister indifferent to him.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.640
我觉得他的爱要比她更多
I realised his attachment was deeper than hers.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:23.810
那是因为她害羞! 
That's because she's shy!

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.650
我说服彬格莱认为  她的感觉并不强烈
Bingley was persuaded she didn't feel strongly.

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:28.860
-那都是你说的  -我这样做是为了他好
- Because you suggested it.  - For his own good.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.860
我姐姐连对我都不吐露她的心声
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.620
我想你是担心她是看上了他的钱吧? 
I suppose his fortune had some bearing?

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:41.370
我无意使你姐姐难堪
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.580
-有迹象表明...  -什么? 
- It was suggested...  - What was?

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:46.210
这门婚事明显是为了谋取利益的...
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:48.750
-我姐姐给你那种印象? -不! 
- Did my sister give that impression?  - No!

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.600
你姐姐没有  然而你的家人...  
No. There was, however, your family...

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.050
你以为我们是为了攀高枝? 
Our want of connection?

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.680
-不  比那更甚  -怎样更甚  先生? 
- No, it was more than that.  - How, sir?

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.760
你母亲  你妹妹们还有你父亲有失身份的表现
The lack of propriety shown by your mother, younger sisters and your father.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.150
请原谅我  你和你姐姐当然没有
Forgive me. You and your sister I must exclude from this.

01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:15.450
那韦翰先生又是怎么回事? 
And what about Mr Wickham?

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700
韦翰先生? 
Mr Wickham?

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:21.660
你对他的所作所为  又能给出什么借口? 
What excuse can you give for your behaviour?

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:23.450
你对他倒是十分关心  
You take an eager interest.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:25.080
他告诉了我他的不幸遭遇
He told me of his misfortunes.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:27.920
-哦  他的确太不幸啦  -你毁了他
- Oh, they have been great.  - You ruin his chances

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.290
现在还讥讽他
yet treat him with sarcasm.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.500
这就是你对我的看法? 
So this is your opinion of me?

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:33.930
谢谢  只怪我老老实实地
Thank you. Perhaps these offences

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.130
把我以前一误再误  迟疑不决的原因说了出来
might have been overlooked

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.680
所以伤害了你的自尊心
had not your pride been hurt

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:40.600
否则你也许就不会计较我得罪你的这些地方了
by my scruples about our relationship.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.970
难道你指望我会为你那些微贱的亲戚而欢欣鼓舞吗? 
I am to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.810
这像是个绅士说的话吗? 
And those are the words of a gentleman.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:51.690
你十足狂妄自大  自私自利  看不起别人
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.180
我早就想好了
made me realise

01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:57.610
哪怕天下男人都死光了  我也不愿意嫁给你
you were the last man in the world I could ever marry.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.880
请原谅  小姐  耽搁了你这么多时间
Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.090
我是来给你这个的
I came to leave you this.

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:34.310
我不会再提起令你极度厌恶的感情
I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.770
但请允许我把你对我的两个误会也说清楚
But if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.700
我父亲爱韦翰先生就像爱自己亲生儿子一样
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:50.790
父亲留给他一个富裕的生活
He left him a generous living.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:52.660
但自从我父亲去世以后
But upon my father's death,

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:57.460
韦翰先生就声称他无意去受圣职
Mr Wickham announced he had no intention of taking orders.

01:14:57.670 --> 01:14:59.150
他要了等值的财产
He demanded the value of the living,

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:03.420
然后把他的身家在数周内全部挥霍豪赌输光了
which he'd gambled away within weeks.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.930
然后他就写信给我要更多的钱  遭到我的断然拒绝
He then wrote, demanding more money, which I refused.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.180
从那以后  与他的联系就完全中断了
After which, he severed all acquaintance.

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.580
去年夏天  他回来找我们
He came back to see us last summer,

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.770
表示对我妹妹强烈爱慕
and declared passionate love for my sister,

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.860
我妹妹竟被他打动了心  答应要跟他私奔
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.690
妹妹她将会继承三万英镑的遗产
She is to inherit ￡30, 000.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.410
但他得知自己从中得不到一个便士时
When it was made clear he would never receive a penny of it,

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:30.280
他马上就消失了
he disappeared.

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:34.120
无须赘言  当时的乔治安娜何等失望
I will not attempt to convey the depth of Georgiana's despair.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.420
当时她才15岁
She was 15 years old.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.050
至于另外一件事  关于你姐姐和彬格莱先生
As to the other matter, of your sister and Mr Bingley,

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.760
虽然我去干涉的动机不够充分
though the motives which governed me may appear insufficient,

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:50.300
但那是我作为他的朋友的一种义务
they were in the service of a friend.

01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:52.510
伊丽莎白
Lizzie.

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:57.600
你还好么? 
Are you all right?

01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:01.150
我自己也不知道
I hardly know.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.240
伊丽莎白  你现在能赶回来真是时候
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:16.120
你的舅舅和舅母把吉英从伦敦送回来了
Your aunt and uncle are here to deliver Jane from London.

01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:19.620
-吉英怎样了? -她现在在客厅
- How is Jane?  - She's in the drawing room.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:24.150
我已经完全忘却他了
I'm quite over him.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:28.340
就算在街上和他擦肩而过  我都不会去注意
If he passed me in the street, I'd hardly notice.

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:32.390
伦敦充满了各种各样有趣的事物  这是真的
London is so diverting. It's true.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:36.850
那里有很多消遣
There's so much to entertain.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.520
在肯特郡  有什么消息啊? 
What news from Kent?

01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:48.400
没什么
Nothing.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.280
起码没有什么可以让我消遣的
At least not much to entertain.

01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:54.240
伊丽莎白  告诉妈妈! 
Lizzie, tell Mama!

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:57.120
不要再小题大做了
Stop making such a fuss.

01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:59.540
为什么费斯托太太不把我也邀请上? 
Why didn't she ask me as well?

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.120
因为我是个更好的同伴
Because I'm better company.

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:03.880
-怎么回事? -我更合适
- What's the matter?  - I've just as much right.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.250
让我们都去吧
Let's all go.

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.380
丽迪雅被邀请去与费斯托家一同去布莱顿
Lydia's been invited to Brighton with the Forsters.

01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:11.590
在海中沐浴将会使我更加美丽
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.050
我可以和军官们每晚一起共进晚餐
I shall dine with the officers every night.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.180
爸爸  不要让她去
Papa, don't let her go.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:19.830
丽迪雅不到公共场所之类的地方去出一出丑
Lydia will never be easy

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.100
是决不肯罢休的
until she'sexposed herself in some public place.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.250
她这次要去出丑
And we could never expect her to do it

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:25.810
既不必花家里的钱  又用不着家里麻烦
with so little inconvenience.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.070
如果爸爸你不制止她
If you do not check her,

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.630
她会被挂上愚蠢的卖俏者的花名
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.990
弄得我们全家都惹人笑话的
who ever made her family ridiculous.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.990
吉蒂也会一如既往地有样学样
And Kitty will follow, as always.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.080
伊丽莎白  如果不让她去  我们将不得安宁
Lizzie, we shall have no peace until she goes.

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.580
原来这才是你关心的? 
Is that really all you care about?

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:47.340
费斯托上校是个有见识的人
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:50.340
他不会让她闯出什么祸事来的
He will keep her out of any real mischief.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:53.340
她太穷  谁也不会看中她
And she's too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:54.680
爸爸  但是这样做很危险
It's dangerous.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:59.430
我肯定军官们会找到更中意的对象
I am certain the officers will find women better worth their while.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.350
我们但愿她去了布莱顿以后
Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.360
能意识到自己有多么渺小
will teach her her own insignificance.

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.190
她再坏也坏不到哪里去
At any rate, she can hardly grow any worse.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.910
如果她真不行的话  我们就把她一辈子关在家里
If she does, we'd be obliged to lock her up for the rest of her life.

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:28.790
伊丽莎白  我们希望你和我们一起去
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.920
山顶区不同于布莱顿
The Peak District is not Brighton.

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:34.630
陆军军官都挺消瘦的  这可能会改变你的决定
Officers are thin on the ground which may influence your decision.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.310
和我们一同去山区吧
Come to the Peak District with us,

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.930
伊丽莎白  去呼吸一下新鲜空气
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:42.680
大自然的风光  人和山石岂可同日而语? 
The glories of nature. What are men compared to rocks and mountains?

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:46.060
男人大多或傲慢或愚蠢
Men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity.

01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:49.570
和蔼可亲的  必定又是没有主见
If they are amiable, they have no minds of their own.

01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:51.200
注意你的言语  我亲爱的
Take care, my love.

01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:53.030
你这句话充满了苦涩的味道
That savours strongly of bitterness.

01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:04.290
在罗新斯的时候  我见到了达西先生
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.040
你为什么不告诉我? 
Why did you not tell me?

01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:11.130
他提到了彬格莱先生吗? 
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.670
没有
No.

01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:21.470
他一句也没提
No, he did not.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.710
噢  人岂可与山石同日而语
Oh, what are men compared to rocks and mountains?

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:32.380
或者马车可以? 
Or carriages that work?

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.800
我们现在具体是在那里? 
Where exactly are we?

01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:41.390
离彭伯里相当近
I think we are quite close to Pemberley.

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.600
-达西先生的家? -就是他
- Mr Darcy's home?  - That's the fellow.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.430
真是一个富饶的湖区  我真的很想去看看
Very well-stocked lake. I've a hankering to see it.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.690
噢  不要  我们不要去
Oh, no, let's not.

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:56.440
他太...
Well, he's so...

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:00.240
我不打算去  因为他太...他太...
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.110
-他怎么了? -他太富有了
- So what?  - So rich.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.450
我的天  伊丽莎白  你还真是势利啊! 
By heavens, Lizzie, what a snob you are!

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.490
因为达西先生富有就反感他
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his wealth.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.370
可怜的他一定很无奈
The poor man can't help it.

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.470
他不会在那里的
He won't be there anyway.

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:15.000
这些人从来都不会呆在家里的
These great men are never at home.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.690
跟上
Keep up.

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.200
您的主人在家的日子多吗? 
Is your master much at home?

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.880
并没有我所期盼的那么多
Not as much as I would wish.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.550
但他绝对喜欢这里
He dearly loves it here.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.470
要是你主人结了婚  你见到他的时候就会多些
If he should marry, you might see more of him.

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.900
他与他父亲真的很像
He's a lot like his father.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.830
我丈夫病了的时候  达西先生都忙不过来
When my husband was ill, Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.250
但他马上为我安排了仆人
He just organised the servants for me.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.730
这就是他  达西先生
This is he, Mr Darcy.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.110
英俊的面庞
A handsome face.

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:46.530
伊丽莎白  这像他么? 
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.160
这位年轻的小姐原来跟达西先生相熟? 
Does the young lady know Mr Darcy?

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.620
不太熟
Only a little.

01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:56.910
你不觉得他是位英俊的少爷吗  小姐? 
Do you not think him a handsome man, miss?

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.500
是的  很英俊
Yes.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.300
是的  我敢说他是英俊的
Yes, I dare say he is.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.760
这是他的妹妹  乔治安娜小姐
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.890
她成天弹琴唱歌
She sings and plays all day long.

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.600
她现在在家么? 
Is she at home?

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:25.850
伊丽莎白小姐
Miss Elizabeth.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.740
-我以为你在伦敦  -不
- I thought you were in London.  - No.

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:44.210
不  我不在伦敦
No, I'm not.

01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:46.080
不在
No.

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.190
我们不会来的  要是知道...  
We would not have come...

01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:49.590
我提早一天回来了...
I came back a day early...

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.800
我与我的舅舅和舅母一起来的
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:01.560
你们的旅途愉快么? 
And are you having a pleasant trip?

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.350
非常开心
Very pleasant.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.020
-我们明天就去马特洛克  -明天? 
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.  - Tomorrow?

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.540
你们是住在兰顿吗? 
Are you staying at Lambton?

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.070
是的  在玫瑰花冠旅馆
Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.320
这样啊
Yes.

01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.700
非常抱歉  闯入你的家
I'm so sorry to intrude.

01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:24.950
舅舅他们说这是对游客开放的  我自己不清楚
They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.340
-我可以送你回村庄去吗? -不用
- May I see you back to the village?  - No.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.380
-我非常喜欢徒步行走  -是的
- I'm very fond of walking.  - Yes.

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.140
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.350
再见  达西先生
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.540
这边请  先生
This way, sir.

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:16.670
你真的不和我们一起吃饭吗? 
Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us?

01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:31.200
我们刚才才见到达西先生
We've just met Mr Darcy.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.270
你没有告诉过我们你曾经见过他
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.590
他邀请我们与他明天一同吃顿便饭
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:38.110
他是一个很有礼貌的人  不是吗? 
He was very civil, was he not?

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.820
-非常有礼貌  -他一点都不像你说的那样
- Very civil.  - Not at all how you'd painted him.

01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:42.370
和他吃饭? 
To dine with him?

01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:46.910
他说话的样子  让人感觉很愉快
There's something pleasant about his mouth when he speaks.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.000
你不介意这样会延误行程吧? 
You don't mind delaying our journey another day?

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.750
他特别点名要你去  见见他的妹妹
He particularly wants you to meet his sister.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.630
他的妹妹
His sister.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.240
伊丽莎白小姐! 
Miss Elizabeth!

01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:32.830
我的妹妹  乔治安娜
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.170
我哥哥给我讲了很多关于你的事情
My brother has told me so much about you,

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.380
-我觉得我们俩就像老朋友一样  -谢谢
- I feel as if we are friends already.  - Thank you.

01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:41.880
-钢琴真漂亮  -我哥哥给我的
- What a beautiful pianoforte.  - My brother gave it to me.

01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:44.050
-他不应该给我的  -当然应该给
- He shouldn't have.  - I should have.

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.470
-好吧  -她真容易被说服  不是么? 
- Very well then.  - Easily persuaded, is she not?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.520
你哥哥曾不得不整晚听着我演奏糟糕的钢琴
He once had to put up with my playing.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.400
-但他说你弹得非常好  -那是他的自欺
- He says you play so well.  - Then he has perjured himself.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.920
我是说"挺好的"  
I said "quite well".

01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.730
是"挺好的"  不是"非常好"
"Quite well" is not "very well".

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.610
这样我就满意了
I'm satisfied.

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.790
-嘉丁纳先生  你喜欢钓鱼吗  -非常喜欢
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?  - Very much.

01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:13.750
今天下午你有兴趣陪我一起去湖边钓鱼吗? 
Would you accompany me to the lake this afternoon?

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.460
湖边的居民已经离开很长一段时间了
Its occupants have been left in peace too long.

01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:18.030
乐意之至  
I would be delighted.

01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:20.840
你会二重奏吗  伊丽莎白小姐? 
Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:26.220
-除非迫不得已  -哥哥  你可得要强迫她
- Only when forced.  - Brother, you must force her.

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:30.180
钓鱼棒极了  很好的同伴  小伙子真不错
Splendid fishing, good company. What a capital fellow.

01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:33.350
太感谢你了  达西先生
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:37.480
你的一封信  小姐
A letter for you, madam.

01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:39.520
噢  是来自吉英的
Oh, it's from Jane.

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:06.180
这真是最可怕不过的消息了
It is the most dreadful news.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.850
丽迪雅逃走了...
Lydia has run away...

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.520
...和韦翰先生一起
...with Mr Wickham.

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.560
天知道他们去哪了
They are gone to Lord knows where.

01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:23.730
她没钱没势  恐怕再也找不着她了
She has no money, no connections. I fear she is lost forever.

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.160
这是我的错
This is my fault.

01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:32.870
当初我要是揭露韦翰的真面目就好了
If only I had exposed Wickham when I should.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.040
不  这是我的错
No, this is my fault.

01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:39.500
如果我当初告诉我妹妹  就可以阻止这一切的发生
I might have prevented all this by being open with my sisters.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.460
有人去找她了吗? 
Has anything been done to recover her?

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:48.720
我父亲去了伦敦  但我知道也于事无补
My father has gone to London, but I know nothing can be done.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.560
我们实在不敢存一线希望
We have not the smallest hope.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.600
希望我能帮你
Would I could help you.

01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.980
先生  我想已经来不及了
Sir, I think it is too late.

01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:05.730
这真令人伤心  我得离开了  告辞
This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.860
我们要马上启程
We must go at once.

01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:09.320
在丽迪雅毁掉这个家以前
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.780
我会去找班纳特先生  和他一同寻找丽迪雅
before she ruins the family.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:44.320
费斯托夫妇怎么竟放心让她离开他们跟前呢? 
Why did the Forsters let her out of their sight?

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.650
我一直觉得他们不适合照管她
I always said they were unfit to take charge of her.

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.610
现在  她已经被糟蹋了  
And now she is ruined.

01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:51.110
你们的声名都被玷污了
You are all ruined.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:56.700
有这样一个堕落的妹妹  现在谁会要你们? 
Who will take you now with a fallen sister?

01:32:56.870 --> 01:33:00.370
可怜的班纳特先生不得不和背信弃义的韦翰决斗
Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:02.120
他一定会被韦翰活活打死
and then be killed.

01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:04.170
爸爸还没有找到他  妈妈
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.170
他尸骨未寒  柯林斯先生就会把我们撵出去
Mr Collins will turn us out before he is cold.

01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:11.260
别那么惊慌  舅舅正在伦敦帮忙寻找着呢
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle is in London helping in the search.

01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:16.680
丽迪雅分明知道这样做对我的神经有多大损害
Lydia must know what this must be doing to my nerves.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:22.100
我现在全身发抖  抽筋! 
Such flutterings and spasms all over me!

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.820
我亲爱的宝贝丽迪雅  我的小宝宝! 
My baby Lydia, my baby!

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.530
她怎么能对可怜的妈妈做出这种事情? 
How could she do such a thing to her poor mama?

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.120
-你不能这样做! -别孩子气了
- You can't do that!  - Don't be such a baby.

01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:38.990
-吉蒂  给我  -这是给谁的? 
- Kitty, give it to me.  - Who's it for?

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.790
地址上写的是给爸爸的
It's addressed to Papa.

01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:44.290
这是舅舅的笔迹
It's in Uncle's writing.

01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:47.250
爸爸  有一封信
Papa, there's a letter.

01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:50.840
-先让我喘口气  -是舅舅的笔迹
- Let me catch my breath.  - It's in Uncle's writing.

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:57.600
-他找到他们了  -他们结婚了么? 
- He's found them.  - Are they married?

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.220
-我看不清他写什么  -给我
- I can't make out his script.  - Give it to me.

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:01.680
他们结婚了么? 
Are they married?

01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:05.050
如果父亲每年给她一百镑  他们就结婚
They will be if Father settles ￡100 a year on her.

01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:06.400
这是他的条件
That is his condition.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.400
-你会接受吗  父亲? -当然
- You will agree to this, Father?  - Of course.

01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:13.950
天知道你舅舅一定在那个卑鄙的人身上花了不少钱
God knows how much your uncle must've laid on that wretched man.

01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:15.320
你是什么意思? 
What do you mean?

01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:17.370
没人会为了每年区区一百镑
No man would marry Lydia

01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:21.750
去娶丽迪雅的
under so slight a temptation as ￡100 a year.

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:24.580
你舅舅肯定花了不少钱
Your uncle must've been very generous.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.880
你说  总数会是一个大数目么? 
Do you think it a large sum?

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.970
韦翰要是没拿到一万镑就答应娶丽迪雅
Wickham's a fool

01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:31.210
那他才是个大傻瓜呢
if he accepts less than ￡10,000.

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:34.220
-天地不容! -父亲! 
- Heaven forbid!  - Father!

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.310
丽迪雅结婚了  而且才15岁! 
Lydia married and at 15 too!

01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:42.390
去拉铃  吉蒂
Ring the bell, Kitty.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.370
我要穿好衣服去告诉卢卡斯女士这个消息
I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas.

01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:47.060
噢  看看她会是什么表情
Oh, to see her face.

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:49.980
告诉仆人们  他们将会有一大碗桃子
Tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch.

01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:52.940
-我们应该去感谢舅舅  -他应该帮忙的
- We should thank our uncle.  - So he should help.

01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:56.610
他比我们有钱得多  又没有孩子  女儿出嫁咯! 
He's far richer than us and has no children. Daughter married!

01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.740
那就是你关心的? 
Is that really all you think about?

01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:02.830
当你有五个女儿的时候  你再告诉我你的想法
When you have five daughters, tell me what else will occupy your thoughts.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.830
到那时  可能你就理解了
Then perhaps you'll understand.

01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:09.000
你根本连他是个什么人都不知道
You don't know what he's like.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.590
-丽迪雅! -噢  妈妈! 
- Lydia!  - Oh, Mama!

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.720
我们与莎拉·辛的车擦肩而过
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:22.760
我就脱下手套  好让她看到我的戒指
So I took off my glove so she might see the ring.

01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:25.890
然后我弯腰大笑  就像...
Then I bowed and smiled like anything...

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:30.690
我相信她连你一半的风光都没有  我亲爱的
I'm sure she was not half as radiant as you, my dear.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.980
你们一定得去去布莱顿
You must all go to Brighton.

01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:34.710
那里才是个找丈夫的地方
That is the place to get husbands.

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:36.780
但愿你们有我一半好运就好啦
I hope you have half my good luck.

01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:38.450
丽迪雅
Lydia.

01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:42.830
我要知道每一个细节  丽迪雅  亲爱的
I want to hear every little detail, Lydia, dear.

01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:46.000
我在北英格兰被应征入伍
I've been enlisted in a regiment in the North of England.

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.790
那真好
Glad to hear it.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.210
在纽卡斯尔附近  我们下个星期就会去那里
Near Newcastle.  We travel there next week.

01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.420
-我能和你们一起去吗? -问都不要问
- Can I come and stay with you?  - That is out of the question.

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:58.430
星期一到了  我还在大惊小怪
Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss.

01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:59.760
我一点也不想听
I don't want to hear.

01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:03.510
舅母一直不住嘴地讲呀  说呀  好像是在传道似的
There was my aunt preaching away as if reading a sermon.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.390
-她很不高兴  -你知道为什么吗? 
- She was horrid unpleasant.  - Can't you understand why?

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.020
但我一个字都听不进
But I didn't hear a word

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.860
因为我满脑子都在惦记我亲爱的韦翰
because I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.690
我一心想要知道  他会不会穿着那件蓝制服结婚
I longed to know if he'd be married in his bluecoat.

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.400
北英格兰  我相信那里会有很多壮观的景色的
The North of England, I believe, boasts some spectacular scenery.

01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:21.490
所以我想  如果他不能回来
So I thought, who is to be our best man

01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.410
谁来做我们的傧相呢? 
if he doesn't come back?

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:27.200
幸好  他回来了  否则我就请达西先生做傧相了
Lucky, he did, or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:31.750
-达西先生! -我怎么完全忘了! 
- Mr Darcy!  - I forgot!

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.750
这事我应该一字不提才对  
But I shouldn't have said a word.

01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:35.340
达西先生在你的婚礼上? 
Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.420
就是他找到我们的
He was the one that discovered us.

01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:43.390
他给了婚礼的费用和韦翰在军队的委托金等所有费用
He paid for the wedding, Wickham's commission, everything.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.470
但是他告诉我要我保密
But he told me not to tell.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.100
-达西先生? -不要这样  伊丽莎白
- Mr Darcy?  - Stop it, Lizzie.

01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:54.270
有时  达西先生还没你这么盛气凌人呢
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty as you sometimes.

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.990
吉蒂  看过我的戒指了么? 
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.330
多给我写写信吧  亲爱的
Write to me often, my dear.

01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:08.620
结了婚的女人是没有什么工夫写信的
Married women never have much time for writing.

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:10.660
我相信你没有
I dare say you won't.

01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:15.840
当年我嫁给你爸爸的时候  时间根本不够用
When I married your father, there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:22.380
姐姐们倒可以写信给我  反正她们也没事做
My sisters may write to me, for they'll have nothing else to do.

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.560
同自己的孩子离别  真是再难受不过的事
There's nothing so bad as parting with one's children.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.400
他们走了  我好像失去了归宿
One seems so forlorn without them.

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:47.950
-再见  -再见  丽迪雅  再见  韦翰先生
- Goodbye.  - Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:52.210
再见  吉蒂  再见  爸爸
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:01.300
真难想象这么多的墨水你爸爸以后怎么用得完
I can't imagine what your father does with all that ink.

01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:03.380
班纳特夫人
Mrs Bennet.

01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:09.180
你听说了吗? 彬格莱先生要回尼日斐花园了
Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:13.480
尼可斯夫人订了猪肉  打算明天招待他
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:16.020
明天? 
Tomorrow?

01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:18.770
我关心的不是他  彬格莱对我们来说算不了什么
Not that I care.  Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:22.240
我永远都不想再见到他  再也不
I'm sure I never want to see him again, no.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.780
我们不应该提起这个事情  他确定要回来了吗? 
We shan't mention a word about it. Is it quite certain he's coming?

01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:29.840
是的  夫人  我想他是一个人来
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.870
他的妹妹还在城里
His sister remains in town.

01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:37.470
为什么他会认为我们有兴趣  我不知道  
Why he thinks we should be interested, I've no idea.

01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:38.840
跟我来  孩子们
Come along, girls.

01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:44.090
我们最好现在马上回家告诉班纳特老爷
We better go home at once and tell Mr Bennet.

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:48.180
真是厚颜无耻  我在想他有没有胆量现身
The impudence of the man. I wonder he dare show his face.

01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:50.390
没什么的  伊丽莎白
It's all right, Lizzie.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.640
他一个人来我真高兴
I'm just glad he's alone

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.560
因为这样我们就可以少点见到他
because we shall see less of him.

01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:58.020
我不是怕自己会怎么样  但我怕人们又要说三道四
Not that I'm afraid of myself. But I dread other people's remarks.

01:38:58.230 --> 01:38:59.860
噢  对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.480
他到了  他到了  他就在门口
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.690
-彬格莱先生! -彬格莱先生? 
- Mr Bingley!  - Mr Bingley?

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.860
噢  我的天啊! 所有人都表现得自然点
Oh, my goodness! Everybody behave naturally.

01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:46.700
无论怎样  都不要太傲慢
And whatever you do, do not appear overbearing.

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.440
还有一个人和他一起来
There's someone with him.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.450
叫什么先生  一个自负的人
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.640
达西先生? 这个傲慢的家伙
Mr Darcy? The insolence of it.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.290
他在想什么  他来这里干什么? 
What does he think of, coming here?

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.110
不要紧张  吉英  曼丽  把它拿开
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at once.

01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:00.380
做点有用的事情  帮帮忙
Find some useful employment.

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:05.420
天哪  我要保持冷静  要镇定  我一定要
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure, I'm sure I shall.

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:07.550
吉蒂
Kitty.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.840
这个不能放在这里  
We can't have this here.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.970
曼丽  那些丝带  丝带
Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.180
曼丽  马上坐好  曼丽! 
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:26.360
达西先生和彬格莱先生到  夫人
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.910
真高兴能见到你  彬格莱先生
How glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.750
自从你走了以后  这一带发生了好多事情
There have been many changes since you went away.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.480
卢卡斯小姐结婚了  有了归宿
Miss Lucas is married and settled.

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:47.880
我自己的一个女儿也出了嫁
And one of my own daughters too.

01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:49.920
你可能在报纸上看到了吧
You will have seen it in the papers,

01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:52.680
上面有消息  不过写得不成体统
though it was not put in as it ought to have been.

01:40:52.890 --> 01:40:56.560
非常短  没有她家庭的介绍
Very short. Nothing about her family.

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.560
是的  我的确听说过  恭喜你们
Yes, I did hear of it. I offer my congratulations.

01:40:59.730 --> 01:41:03.150
然而丽迪雅离开我身边  我又觉得难受
But it is very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me.

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:07.400
韦翰被调去纽卡斯尔
Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, wherever that is.

01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:09.440
你会在乡下呆很长的时间么? 
Will you stay long in the country?

01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:11.860
只是几个星期  是来打猎的
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:14.120
等你把你自己庄园里的鸟儿打完以后
When you've killed all your own birds,

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.890
请到班纳特老爷的庄园里来
I beg you will come here

01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:17.370
你爱打多少就打多少
and shoot as many as you please.

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.650
我相信他一定非常乐意让你来
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige

01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:22.080
而且会把最好的鹧鸪都留给你
and will save the best coveys for you.

01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:24.750
太好了
Excellent.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:28.840
-你好吗  达西先生? -非常好  谢谢
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?  - Quite well, thank you.

01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:31.380
我希望天气为你的捕猎保持晴朗
I hope the weather stays fine for your sport.

01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:35.050
-我明天就回城了  -这么快? 
- I return to town tomorrow.  - So soon?

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:41.270
我的吉英看起来不错吧  不是吗? 
My Jane looks well, does she not?

01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.230
她的确看起来很好
She does indeed.

01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:55.370
好了  我想我们要走了
Well, we must be going, I think.

01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:59.740
达西  能再次见到你们  我们感到高兴
Darcy. It's been very pleasant to see you all again.

01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:01.910
伊丽莎白小姐  班纳特小姐
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.500
你一定要再来
You must come again.

01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:07.170
去年冬天  你答应要上我们这儿来吃顿便饭
Last winter, you promised to have a family dinner with us.

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:10.450
你要知道  我一直都把这事放在心上
I've not forgot, you see.

01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:12.170
至少三道主菜呢
At least three courses.

01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:19.680
请原谅
Excuse me.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.360
非常奇怪
Most extraordinary.

01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:42.870
我们当时走进去  然后她说  "请坐"
We were going to walk in and she was going to say, "Sit down."

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.120
所以  我觉得...
So, I feel...

01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:57.390
噢  这真是一场灾难! 
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:59.550
这是...
It's been...

01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.140
-班纳特小姐  -彬格莱先生
- Miss Bennet.  - Mr Bingley.

01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:07.150
我要直接走进去  然后说出来
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:09.610
好  正是要这样
Yes, exactly.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.300
我很高兴我们结束了
I'm glad that's over.

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.030
现在我们两个见面就像素不相识的两个人
Now we can meet as indifferent acquaintances.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200
哦  是哦
Oh, yes.

01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:22.490
你可别以为我那么软弱  还会招来什么危险
You cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:26.540
我看你有极大的危险  会使他如痴如醉地爱你
You are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.

01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:31.740
真抱歉  他把达西先生也带来了  
I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:32.880
别那样说
Don't say that.

01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:35.300
为什么? 
Why ever not?

01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:41.220
吉英
Jane.

01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:46.270
-我一直那么盲目  -你说的是什么意思? 
- I've been so blind.  - What do you mean?

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.230
看  是他  他回来了  他又来了
Look, it's him. He's back. He's come again.

01:43:57.610 --> 01:43:59.570
我知道这一切都很唐突
I know this is all very untoward,

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:03.990
但我希望能有与班纳特小姐交谈的机会
but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.330
单独交谈
Alone.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.170
所有人都立即去厨房
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:16.380
当然除了你  吉英  我亲爱的
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:23.390
噢  彬格莱先生  能这么快再见到你  真是太好了
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good to see you again so soon.

01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:48.250
首先  我要告诉你  我是一个最愚昧无知的蠢货
First, I must tell you I've been the most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.220
吉蒂  安静点
Kitty, be quiet.

01:45:20.610 --> 01:45:23.070
我答应你
Yes.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.530
千千万万次答应你
A thousand times yes.

01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:34.380
谢天谢地  我还以为这永远都不会发生
Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.

01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.090
我相信他们在一起会幸福的
I am confident they will do well together.

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:29.260
他们的性格很相似
Their tempers are much alike.

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:34.270
他们那么好讲话  会被仆人们欺负的
They will be cheated assiduously by their servants.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.650
他们都那么慷慨  到头来一定会入不敷出的
And be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:45.400
入不敷出? 他一年有五千英镑收入
Exceed their income? He has 5,000 a year.

01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:52.870
我一向认为她不会白白生得这么美丽
I knew she did not be so beautiful for nothing.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:03.710
"...要远离所有的违心
"...must be free from all insincerity.

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.550
她只能是设身处地去理解他人
She only can address herself effectually to the feelings of others

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.010
那些人因为情感得到了温暖  思想更为活跃
whose mind glows with the warmth of sensibility

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:13.970
因为有了信念而善于辩驳
and whose arguments result from conviction.

01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:17.650
她一定感受到激情和情感的影响
She must feel the influence of those passions and emotions

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:21.020
她希望能因此激发灵感..."
which she wishes to inspire..."

01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:44.090
你会因为太幸福而死去吗? 
Can you die of happiness?

01:47:45.670 --> 01:47:48.680
他说春天时完全不知道我也在城里
He was ignorant of my being in town in the spring.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.820
他有没有说明是什么缘故? 
How did he account for it?

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.930
他以为我不爱他
He thought me indifferent.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.850
-深不可测啊  -一定是他妹妹说我坏话的
- Unfathomable.  - No doubt poisoned by his sister.

01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.610
精彩! 我生平只听到你讲这一句气量小的话
Bravo. That's the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.

01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:03.980
噢  伊丽莎白  但愿你也会同样的幸福
Oh, Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy.

01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:06.490
但愿你也能找到这样一个人
If there was such a man for you.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.490
说不定柯林斯还有个堂兄弟
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:18.120
-那是什么声音? -什么? 
- What is that?  - What?

01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:21.380
也许他改变了主意
Maybe he's changed his mind.

01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:25.710
来啦! 
Coming!

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.220
哪位? 
Yes?

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.260
凯瑟琳夫人
Lady Catherine.

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:42.860
我想这些就是你其余的孩子们了? 
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.780
还有一个不在  最小的女儿最近出嫁了
All but one. The youngest has been lately married, your Ladyship.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.900
大女儿下午刚刚订婚
My eldest was proposed to only this afternoon.

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.850
你们这儿还有个小花园呢  
You have a very small garden.

01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:55.780
要不要给你倒杯茶? 
Could I offer you a cup of tea?

01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:59.370
不必了  我要和伊丽莎白·班纳特单独交谈一会
Absolutely not. I need to speak to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:02.420
有件要紧的事情
As a matter of urgency.

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.720
你一定不会不知道我为什么来吧
You can be at no loss to understand why I am here.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.180
我完全不明白怎么会当得起你亲自上门这份荣耀
I cannot account for this honour at all.

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:16.600
我警告你  我是决不肯让人家来跟我开玩笑的
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.140
我听到一个极其惊人的消息
A most alarming report has reached me.

01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:23.850
你试图攀上我的侄儿达西先生
That you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.340
虽然我明知这是无稽之谈
I know this to be a falsehood.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.940
虽然我不会那样看不起他
Though not wishing to

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.600
以为他真会看上你
injure him by supposing it possible,

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.740
我还是立即过来这里  向你表明我的态度
I instantly set off to make my sentiments known.

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.990
你既然认为不可能  又何必大老远跑来
If you believed it impossible, I wonder that you came so far.

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.530
我是想亲耳听到这则消息是假的
To hear it contradicted.

01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:37.970
如果外界真有这种流言
Your coming will be a confirmation

01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:40.120
那么你的来访只会令流言弄假成真
if such a report exists.

01:49:40.330 --> 01:49:43.580
如果? 你假装对此事一无所知? 
If? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:46.750
难道这不是你自己拼命传出去的吗? 
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself?

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.800
我从来没有听说过
I have never heard of it.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.380
你能保证这次是空穴来风? 
Can you declare there is no foundation for it?

01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:55.090
我并不打算装得像你老人家一样坦白
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship.

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:56.330
你可以问
You may ask a question

01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:58.350
但我有权利选择回答或者不回答
which I may choose not to answer.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.850
我的侄子究竟向你求过婚没有? 
Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:04.100
你老人家自己刚刚还说过这绝不可能
Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.

01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:06.060
达西先生早跟我的女儿订过婚了
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.

01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.860
好吧  你还有什么话要说? 
Now what have you to say?

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.780
如果当真如此  那你就没有理由认为他会向我求婚
If that is the case, you cannot suppose he would make an offer to me.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:17.070
你真是自私  这门婚事是从他们小时候就定下来的
You selfish girl. This union has been planned since their infancy.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.620
你以为出身卑贱的你能够从中作梗? 
Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth

01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:22.260
何况你妹妹与人私奔
whose own sister's elopement

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:25.290
靠舅舅出钱资助
resulted in a scandalously patched-up marriage

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:28.750
才勉强结成了一门可耻不堪的婚事
only achieved at the expense of your uncle.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:29.790
我的上帝啊! 
Heaven and Earth!

01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:32.840
难道彭伯里就要这样被你们这些人玷污么? 
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

01:50:33.010 --> 01:50:35.550
爽爽快快告诉我  你究竟跟他订婚了没有? 
Tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?

01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:41.220
没有
I am not.

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:45.060
你愿意答应我  永远不跟他订婚吗? 
Will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?

01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:47.440
我不会答应你  我当然永远不答应
I will not and I certainly never shall.

01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:51.610
你把我侮辱得够了
You have insulted me in every possible way

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:54.570
我不想再讲了
and can now have nothing further to say.

01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:58.570
你现在马上给我离开
I must ask you to leave immediately.

01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:02.200
晚安
Goodnight.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.960
我一辈子都没有被这样对待过! 
I have never been thus treated in my entire life!

01:51:09.170 --> 01:51:12.670
-发生什么事情了? -只是个小小的误会
- What is going on?  - Just a small misunderstanding.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.090
求求你们  让我一个人静一下! 
For once in your life, leave me alone!

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.470
-我睡不着  -我也是  我姑妈...
- I couldn't sleep.  - Nor I. My aunt...

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:11.810
是的  她昨晚来过
Yes, she was here.

01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:15.150
我真希望我可以为昨晚的事情做出补偿? 
How can I ever make amends for such behaviour?

01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:17.690
经过丽迪雅的事情后
After what you've done for Lydia

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.190
还有吉英的事情  我想做补偿的人应该是我
and, I suspect, for Jane, it is I who should be making amends.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.420
你得知道
You must know.

01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:27.320
你一定得知道  我做这一切都是为了你
Surely you must know it was all for you.

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:32.950
你是个爽快的人  绝不会开我的玩笑
You are too generous to trifle with me.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.540
昨做你与我姑妈的谈话  倒让我觉得事情有了希望
You spoke with my aunt last night and it has taught me to hope

01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:39.420
以前我几乎不敢奢望
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.930
请你老实告诉我  你的心情是否还和四月里一样
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.

01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:49.100
我的心愿和情感依然如旧
My affections and wishes have not changed.

01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:52.470
只要你说一句话  我便再也不提这桩事
But one word from you will silence me for ever.

01:54:57.690 --> 01:55:01.980
如果  你的感觉有所改变的话...
If, however, your feelings have changed...

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.990
...我想告诉你
...I would have to tell you,

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.030
你把我的躯体和灵魂都占据了  我爱...
you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love...

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:13.290
我爱...我爱你
I love... I love you.

01:55:13.450 --> 01:55:16.410
从今天起我不想与你分开
I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.

01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:29.800
唔
Well, then.

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.390
你的手好冷
Your hands are cold.

01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:23.690
请关门
Shut the door, please.

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:40.120
你疯了吗? 我以为你讨厌那个人
Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.

01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:45.340
-不  爸爸  -他当然有的是钱  那是肯定的
- No, Papa.  - He is rich, to be sure.

01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:49.380
可以使你的马车比吉英的更加豪华
And you will have more fine carriages than Jane.

01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:52.010
难道这就会使你幸福吗? 
But will that make you happy?

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.770
你认为我对他并没有感情
Have you no other objection

01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:56.310
除此以外  你还有别的反对意见吗? 
than your belief in my indifference?

01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:58.680
一点没有
None at all.

01:56:58.850 --> 01:57:03.730
我们都知道他是傲慢而不易亲近的人
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.320
不过  只要你真正喜欢他  这也无关紧要
But this would be nothing if you liked him.

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.190
我真的喜欢他
I do like him.

01:57:10.610 --> 01:57:12.160
我爱他
I love him.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.170
他不傲慢.  我是错的
He's not proud. I was wrong.

01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:20.000
我以前对他的看法是完全错的
I was entirely wrong about him.

01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:26.710
你不了解他  爸爸  如果我告诉你他真正的一面
You don't know him, Papa. If I told you what he was really like,

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:28.090
他做的事情...
what he's done...

01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:31.130
他做了什么? 
What has he done?

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:42.980
但她不喜欢他  我以为她不喜欢他
But she doesn't like him. I thought she didn't like him.

01:57:43.190 --> 01:57:46.860
我也是这样想  我们以前都这样认为的
So did I. So did we all.

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:49.730
我们都错了
We must have been wrong.

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:52.390
这也不是第一次吧? 
It won't be the first time, will it?

01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:55.450
不  我敢说  也不会是最后一次
No, nor the last, I dare say.

01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:02.750
我的天
Good Lord.

01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.420
-我必须要偿还他  -不
- I must pay him back.  - No.

01:58:09.590 --> 01:58:13.170
你不能告诉其他人  他不希望那样
You mustn't tell anyone. He wouldn't want it.

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:14.930
我们误解他了  爸爸
We misjudged him, Papa.

01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:17.680
我对他的误解比你们都深  都深
Me more than anyone. In every way.

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:21.220
并不只是这件事
Not just in this matter.

01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:24.060
我真是愚昧无知
I've been nonsensical.

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:27.350
但在吉英的事情上  他就像个蠢蛋一样
But he's been a fool about Jane,

01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:29.190
对很多事都是这样
about so many other things.

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:32.820
但是  我也是一样
But then, so have I.

01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:38.490
你知道的  他和我...
You see, he and I are...

01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:43.910
他和我挺像的
He and I are so similar.

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.460
我们两个的性格都很固执
We're both so stubborn.

01:58:49.130 --> 01:58:50.840
爸爸  我...
Papa, I...

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.180
你真的是很爱他  不是吗? 
You really do love him, don't you?

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.930
非常爱
Very much.

01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:11.110
我真不敢相信有人会配得上你
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you.

01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:15.490
现在看起来  是我看错了
But it seems I am overruled.

01:59:15.650 --> 01:59:20.280
我衷心地祝福你们
So I heartily give my consent.

01:59:28.670 --> 01:59:33.550
我是不想把你随便嫁给别人  我的伊丽莎白
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:37.880
谢谢你
Thank you.

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:54.370
如果有其他年轻的小伙子来找曼丽或者吉蒂
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:56.490
看在老天的份上  让他们进来吧
for heaven's sake, send them in.

01:59:56.690 --> 01:59:59.240
我现在的生活可真是清闲
I'm quite at my leisure.

01:59:59.570 --> 02:00:16.000
***谢谢收看***
下面的字幕感谢www.silu.info雪还是白的提供

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.700
你睡得好吗? 亲爱的? 
How are you this evening, my dear?

02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.100
非常好
Very well.

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.300
-希望你别再叫我"亲爱的"了  -为什么? 
-Only I wish you would not call me "my dear".  -Why?

02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:30.100
因为每当我父亲生气时才会如此称呼我母亲
Because it's what my father always calls my mother when he's cross about something.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.500
那我可以怎么称呼你呢? 
What endearments am I allowed?

02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:32.700
哦  让我想想看
Well let me think...

02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:35.100
寻常日子叫我"丽兹"
"Lizzie" for everyday

02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:37.700
星期天可以叫我"小傻瓜"
 "My Pearl" for Sundays

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:39.100
另外...
and...

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:43.400
在某些情况下  可以叫我"神气活现"
"Goddess Divine", but only on very special occasions.

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:47.400
那么  我生气时该怎么叫你呢? 
And...what should I call you when I am cross?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.500
达西夫人? 
"Mrs. Darcy"?

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:52.400
不...不
No! No.

02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:55.700
你只能在以下的情况下叫我"达西夫人"  
You may only call me "Mrs. Darcy"...

02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:01.400
即当你完完全全  千真万确  毫无疑问地觉得幸福时
when you are completely, and perfectly, and incandescently happy.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.400
你今晚过得怎么样? 
Then how are you this evening... Mrs. Darcy?

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.200
达西夫人? 
Mrs. Darcy

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:19.300
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:24.200
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.000
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.000
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy
